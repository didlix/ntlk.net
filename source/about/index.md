I'm Natalia Buckley, interaction designer based in Brighton/London and member of [BuildBrighton][]. 

This is my personal blog where I intend to write about physical computing, interaction design and my ongoing projects.

If you'd like to see some of my work, have a look at my [portfolio][].

This blog uses [Jekyll][] with [Octopress][] framework to generate static pages, and is still in development. I will add features as they become needed.

You can get in touch with my by [email][] or [Twitter][].
