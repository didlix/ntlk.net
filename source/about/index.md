I'm Nat Buckley, technologist and interaction designer based in Brighton/London. I imagine, make, break and fix things. Can be occasionally spotted at [BuildBrighton][]. 

This is my personal blog where I intend to talk about physical computing, interaction design and my ongoing projects. It has evolved to be a place where I mainly put my own writing, while interesting things I find live on my [Tumblr][].

If you'd like to see some of my work, have a look at my [portfolio][].

This blog uses [Jekyll][] with [Octopress][] framework to generate static pages.

You can get in touch with my by [email][] or [Twitter][].
