I got today one of [Jason][1]'s awesome [lo-fi games console kits][2]. Each console is tiny (smaller than Raspberry Pi), has five push buttons and lets you play games on an 8 by 8 pixel screen. Brilliant.

You've got to solder them together yourself, but they come pre-programmed with four games: Space Invaders, Breakout, Connect 4 and Simon Says type thing. You can [make your own games][4] and program the chip using an FTDI cable.

There's an extensive [wiki on GitHub][5] to help you put it together, and of course [the code is available there too][6]. Now excuse me while I try to not lose all my lives in 30 seconds and shoot down all space invaders.
