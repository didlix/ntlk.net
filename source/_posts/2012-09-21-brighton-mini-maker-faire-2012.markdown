Apparently over 7000 people have visited Brighton Mini Maker Faire this years, so there's a chance that if you live in Brighton you were one of them. 

[I've written a post][1] for the [ORGZine][2] about what it is and what were my highlights, so I won't repeat that here, instead I just wanted to thank everyone involved. The amazing makers who came to show their wonderful inventions, all other organisers, our tireless volunteers and of course, the generous speakers who came to share tips on their creative process.

If you've missed it, check out the [BMMF Flickr group][3] to see some of the projects on display.
