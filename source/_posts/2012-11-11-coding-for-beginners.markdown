In September I ran [two workshops with year 10 students][13] here in Brighton, as part of [Lighthouse][12]'s educational programme for [Brighton Digital Festival][14]. We made games in Scratch together. That was my first opportunity to work with people so young, and the difference sin their approach to learning, as opposed to adults I have shared my skills with, were quite interesting. As I am preparing creative coding workshops I'll be running at [Goldsmiths][17] in December, and working on some [CodeClub][18] projects, I am having to think a lot about approach to teaching how to code.

With adults, I have focused on showing what's possible with code, and trying to inspire them enough to make overcoming the first period of learning a bit less of a daunting task. I assumed that as non-technical audience they may see learning programming as very difficult. It's certainly how I saw it to start with, but I kept at it despite failing to grasp concepts and finding syntax of some of the languages unintuitive. I did so because I knew what awaited me: the power to create something, anything, out of nothing. The only barrier was my willingness to stick it out. I hoped similar approach could work for others.

Kids, on the other hand, did not need to be inspired or encouraged to try something new and tricky. They just did. We were building games using Scratch, which makes learning to code more accessible in many ways. First of all, it's a visual environment, where it’s easy to snap commands together, nest them or move them around. Secondly, all possible commands are visible, so when you’re stuck it’s easy to peruse them and maybe find something suitable. Thirdly, it has a built in collection of sounds and images that can be used in games or application. It's a breeze to get started.

In one of the sessions with kids I had a very small group, so I was able to let them do whatever they wanted and help each one of them separately. They all made different games, and I could adapt how I explain things based on their projects. I was there to get them started and guide them when they got stuck, but they honestly needed no encouragement whatsoever. Before I knew it they have explored the possibilities of Scratch beyond what I was able to cover and amazed me with their ingenuity and creativity. 

With adult beginners though my primary focus is on encouraging that playful approach. My aim was never to prepare for the glamorous life of a programmer, or to teach a specific language in depth (not that I know any one of them that well), but rather to foster the same kind of hacker mentality that I always found appealing: figuring out how things work, being able to learn anything by poking them and just trying things out. There’s a huge difference between career programming and coding as a hobby and I’m not so interested in the former. 

Coding is a creative endeavour. As [Zed A. Shaw][10] wrote in ["Learn Python the hard way"][11], "as an intellectual activity [programming] is the only art form that allows you to create interactive art. You can create projects that other people can play with, and you can talk to them indirectly. No other art form is quite this interactive. Movies flow to the audience in one direction. Paintings do not move. Code goes both ways."

In school most people got to try drawing or playing instruments. Trying out code should sit in the same category: as a creative pursuit that you should at least try before you decide whether you like it or not. There is a huge drive now to get kids to do just that, whether it's to give them skills required by the modern world or whether it's about teaching creative ways of thinking. [CodeClub][18] is one of the initiatives that has the potential to not just show how much this is needed, but provides the solutions. Kids will be okay. 

I am interested in the generation that sits between those who had BBC Micros at home and kids of today. It can be prohibitively expensive to just try it out. [Decoded][15] was a series of workshops which, [judging by the feedback from their attendees][16], were absolutely brilliant. However, with a price tag of over £500 it's not something just anyone could do.

It is often said among programmers that all you need to learn is access to the internet, as you can find free books, tutorials and communities to ask questions – it's all readily available. It's true that there are many approaches to sharing the knowledge and the likelihood is that every learning style is catered for, but finding good resources and going it alone can be tricky.

Still, there is for example [Don't Fear the Internet][3], a brilliant series of screencasts explaining HTML & CSS in an approachable manner. There is [CodeAcademy][4] which now has courses on several languages and allows users to build their own challenges and exercises. I have to say that I found some of them a little tedious and mechanical, though many beginners find them useful. [GOOD magazine][6] has recently launched it's own [web basics course][5], with prizes for the most adept participants. There are more and more resources, and I think they are becoming easier to come across, but since I look out for these things I may be a little biased.

The most exciting space to watch right now is development of programming tools. [Bret Victor][1] wrote an [absolutely superb essay][2] on improving the way people learn to code by improving those. He points out that getting beginners to randomly change numbers in short programs and thus figure out how it all works is absurd, and there should be better ways of knowing what the syntax means and how the program is executed step by step. It's a long piece of writing, but it's absolutely worth it and I wholeheartedly recommend [you read it][2].

He spoke about it during a presentation he gave at [CUSEC 2012][9], and has shown a prototype of a tool that would make learning programming and creating with programming easier. To him it's about having a direct connection to your creation, and allowing yourself to discover things through this immediacy.

Having tools like this to show to beginners would be brilliant. Staring at code which you cannot understand can be intimidating in a way that playing with buttons, sliders and dials isn't. Modern electronic instruments make it easy to just pick them up and start playing with them even if you lack any music knowledge, modern programming tools should do the same.
