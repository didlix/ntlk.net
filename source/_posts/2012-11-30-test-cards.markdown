I was testing different circuits with conductive paint in preparation for the [Bling My Card][1] workshop/party next week. I wanted to see if the circuits can be incorporated into card designs, and if so, how complex they could get. 

In short: not complex at all - especially when it's important they need to be debugged easily while drinking mulled wine. In the case of the reindeer card below it was tricky to figure out what went wrong: too many lines, not enough paint, a stray connection somewhere... As there could be many attendees who have never done any electronics before it will be best to keep things that can go wrong to a minimum and keep circuits very simple.

I also found out that paint applied as a thin layer with a thick brush didn't work so well. The card below was one of the failures. I could tell with a multimeter that a current was passing through the paint, but it wasn't enough to light up the LED. The paint lines need to be fairly narrow and thick - that kind of application definitely worked best.

Now, the drying bit. Some [Bare Conductive tutorials][2] say the paint will take about 10 mins to dry, but I've found it takes a bit longer, possibly even up to an hour, when applied this thickly.

The circuits without switches were ultimately a lot more rewarding, as you could keep checking if the LED is on yet, argue about whether it is, and observe it become noticeably brighter every time you look at it. The paint becomes more conductive as it dries, so when you first apply it it's hard to tell if you've done it right. Switches were a little bit less fun, as you got to wait for them to dry almost fully before you can test them. On the other hand the switch will make your battery last longer.

I've got to make a couple of nice sample cards to show what they could look like. If you'd like to make some with me and you're free on the 5th December, you should [come to the workshop][1].
