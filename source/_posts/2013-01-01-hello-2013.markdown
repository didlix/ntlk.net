2012 started off well â€“ I had a great job I enjoyed, working with [Webponce][1]. We spent plenty of time on non-commercial and speculative projects. I had the best job title (Near-Futures Explorer, since you ask), awesome boss, and flexible working practices.

In April I've left this job (not without a great deal of sadness) to become a technologist in residence at [Lighthouse][2] as part of [Happenstance][3], which resulted in building [Offbott][4] with [James Bridle][5] and [running workshops teaching to code][6].

I have been taking on freelance work since second year at university, but after Happenstance I decided to do it full-time. Having been spoilt by having so much freedom in my working arrangements it seemed like the best thing to do. It meant I had the chance to work with [Caper][7] on exciting cultural projects such as [Alarum][9] for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, and with [Storythings][10] on building interactive things.

During Happenstance sharing my skills turned out to be both enjoyable and educational, so I was keen to continue doing it. I ran a short [game-making workshop][11] for local secondary school students as a part of Lighthouse's educational programme for [Brighton Digital Festival][12]. The year has finished with a [coding workshop][13] I did with [Goldsmiths][14] design students, who were on the same [course][15] I graduated from.

I was able to devote some time to helping organise [Brighton Mini Maker Faire][16] which took place in September. I've invited [Tom Armitage][17], [Alice Taylor][18], [Matt Webb][19], [Linda Sandvik][20] representing [Code Club][22], [Leila Johnston][21] and students from Cavendish School to talk at the event about their approach to making things. Afterwards I swore I wouldn't organise events anymore as it's exhausting, but I quickly forgot about that and organised [Bling My Card][23] workshop together with Lighthouse to raise money for [Rockinghorse][24].

Towards the end of the year I got inspired by the idea of "[blogging like it's 2004][25]" so I have been trying to be a lot less precious with my blog posts. I am hoping this is going to have a ripple effect on my personal projects so I will be talking about them more even if they are unfinished and imperfect. If I did the New Year resolution thing that would be one of them, but I don't, so let's leave it at that.
