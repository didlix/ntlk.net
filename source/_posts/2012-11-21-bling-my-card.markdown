Some time back I have been working with [Caper][1] on a project which led me to the discovery of [Bare Conductive's][2] [conductive paint][3]. I got very excited at the prospect of being able to do a gentle introduction into the world of electronics though a very inviting medium of making a mess on paper with the tools you already know how to use. 

Bare Conductive were one of the sponsors of the [Brighton Mini Maker Faire][10] this year, and I briefly spoke to them - they are very nice people. I hope this post doesn't sound like an advertiorial, but really, I only have positive things to say about possibilities it creates in making and teaching electronics. I've seen [Bare's card making kits][11], and whilst simple and fun to make, they introduce some very basic concepts of electronics with no effort at all.

So to try out infecting a large number of people with a making and tinkering bug, I will be running a [half-party, half-workshop making Christmas cards][7] with some LEDS in (aptly named [Bling My Card][7] - thanks [Dean][9]). Guaranteed to put you in a festive mood. It's on 5th December, from 6pm to 8pm, and [tickets are £12][8] - this covers the cost of the materials, and any profit goes to [Rockinghorse][6]. That, and you get the become a part of an experiment which will test how many people I can infect with a new hobby in a single evening. 

If you're not in Brighton or are busy you can [make some awesome cards][12] on your own: Bare have prepared a very thorough [tutorial][12] explaining everything you need to know (which is very little).

Of course, conductive paint lends itself to so much more than cardmaking, which is what I would like to play with once I get some spare time again. There are folks working on some interesting innovative projects that benefit from the tactile quality of making bendable circuits on paper.

[Antonio Gomes][5] made an interface that uses the paint and conductive gloves to control music.

You can see more examples of some cool projects [here][4].
