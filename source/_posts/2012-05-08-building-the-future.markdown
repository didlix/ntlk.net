![One does not simply design in a vacuum](/images/design_vacuum.png)

Graduating from a design course at Goldsmiths bestowed me with a sense of power and a sense of responsibility. You don't casually design stuff that will affect people's lives without stopping first to think about it.

We're finally collectively waking up to the fact that the tools of the future are largely software tools. I design and make digital things - they can sometimes seem like not real things at all. They appear so ethereal that my parents struggle to describe to friends and family what it is I do for a living. And yet with every design decision, every small feature, or lack of feature, or way of doing things - I know it can affect how people relate to one another. [Jonathan Harris][3] predicts the burden of responsibility is about to get heavier - eventually the software will be followed by hardware embedded in our bodies.

> Software is the staging ground for the future, affording us the time and space to get our ethics right, before the stakes are raised.

> Because, the way these biological interventions will happen is that there will be some guy who starts a company, and he will have a small design team, and they will make certain choices, and decisions around things like default settings, and they will build their product, and release it into the world, and early adopters will adopt it, and then ordinary folks will try it too, and soon thereafter the physical bodies of millions of people will forever be augmented by the flippant choices made on a Tuesday afternoon in a little sunny room in Palo Alto.

Which is why I'm worried, and so should you be, because it means your life in the future is being decided by people who may have very little in common with you, and may not understand your needs at all. Worse: they may not even care. Even worse: they may see profit in actively working against your needs.

Case in point: [Google+ nymwars][4]. Not long after its launch, Google decided to start shutting down profiles of people who didn't use their real names to sign up to the service. On one hand of course they have a right to do that, it's their business after all to know everything about you so they can adequately price your eyeballs. At the same time, due to their size and prominence, shouldn't large companies feel responsible about decisions they make becoming the de facto standard? "Waah, but [pseudonymity][6] and [anonymity][7] are only for BAD people who have something to hide" - I hear you think, but before you say it, check if you can see yourself on this [very long list of people that are harmed by real name policies][5]. We might find ourselves in twenty years time with a stifled freedom of expression, because we fell for a straw-man argument against one real, unified identity online - argument that someone created to make profit.

Technology is often perceived as somewhat scientific and objective, especially by non-technical audiences. I've come to think this is a lie. Recently, I saw [Scott Porad][9] speak about it at [Bacon][8]. "Software is a reflection of people and processes that created it", he argued, and I wholeheartedly agreed. And it's not just the software. Everywhere where decisions made that have an effect on other people - there will be biases.

But biases don't always have to be a bad thing. Many tools and technologies in existence express positive values: pursuit of happiness, real human connection, attempts to fix difficult problems. Some contributors do so in their spare time, only rewarded with gratitude and sense of satisfaction. 

The challenge is to empower more people to actively participate in thinking about and building TEH FUTURE. So why not [teach kids to code][2] or [help others do so][1]?
