[Samson and Goliath][1] are huge shipbuilding gantry cranes in Belfast. I have fallen in love with them as soon as I saw them because they remind me of my home town, Szczecin. Szczecin's shipyard also had two huge yellow gantry cranes towering over the city, always there in the background to orientate yourself by.

I have come across reports that the Szczecin's cranes are up for sale, and may leave my home town in due course. I don't know how much of this is true, but this is still heartbreaking news. A gantry crane in Ulsan in South Korea [has been named _Tears of Malmö_][2] after the sadness caused by the crane being sold and removed from its place of origin, Malmö, where it has lived for 28 years. I hope Szczecin's cranes will be named _Tears of Szczecin_ if they leave home.

[Stocznia Szczecińska][3] (Szczecin Shipyard) has changed hands multiple times, beginning straight after the WWII when Szczecin (formerly Stettin) when the whole region was taken over by Poland. In 2009 it has been shut down and its liquidation has begun.

The shipyards in Poland were one of the places where resistance to communist dictatorship began forming. In December 1970 at Stocznia Szczecińska the workers protested about the rising food prices and "surrounding reality" (as did workers of other shipyards in the country), a protest to which the state reacted with violence, killing sixteen people and injuring over a hundred just in Szczecin. Near the shipyard's entrance there's a monument with the names of the killed.

The industry is moving away, taking with it its most valuable remnants and only leaving a gaping hole.

Samson and Goliath, on the other hand, were "scheduled as historic monuments under Article 3 of the Historic Monuments and Archaeological Objects (Northern Ireland) Order 1995" (source: [Wikipedia][1]) which means they are there to stay.

I couldn't find the names of the cranes in Szczecin, and I'm not even sure they have any. I wish they were as loved in their home place as the Samson and Goliath are.
