It's been nearly three weeks since, but I haven't had the chance to grab a moment to write about the wonderful event that was the first Brighton Mini Maker Faire. It was a truly exciting festival of experimentation, creativity and discovery.

One of my favourite projects was the drawing robot. As the model sits down to be sketched, a tiny camera turns to their face and takes a snapshot from which to work. A robotic arm draws the model's face in strange, sketchy movements that slowly build up the drawing. Periodically, the arm stops and the camera turns from paper to model's face, pretending to have another look. I was to be honest more excited about that humanised interaction between the person and the machine than I was about the technical challenges of making a drawing arm.

Running soldering drop-in was the highlight of the day for me. I had the chance to show kids how to put together some electronic kits and watch them own me when it comes to my soldering skills. Heck, I even offered [adactio][1] a quick soldering lesson (no, he didn't take it).

I wanted to say thank you to everyone who got involved in organising it and everyone who turned up on the day to look at and play with some amazing creations! We're told more than 5000 people came through the door. None of this would have been possible without a massive group of volunteers, and organisers who have taken on a huge challenge and worked for months to make it happen. Let's hope next year we can make it even bigger.
