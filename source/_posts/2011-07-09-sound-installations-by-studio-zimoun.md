Feasting my eyes and ears on these. [Zimoun][2] specialises in creating sound installations generated by mechanical movements. Many of his works use rotating motors to bump small objects against each other. Result is strangely organic and captivating. 

There are many more fantastic videos of his work on [Vimeo][1]. Well worth a look.
