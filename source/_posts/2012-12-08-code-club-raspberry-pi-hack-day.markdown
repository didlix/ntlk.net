Today I went to [Code Club][1]'s Raspberry Pi hack day. The aim is to create some projects Code Club students could do with Rasberry Pis in their schools. I had to leave early, so I have utterly failed at making a cool project
, I have however filled plenty of balloons with helium (probably the most important job of the day).

There were slush puppies available.

And Play-Doh. And Jelly Beans. And of course a whole load of [Raspberry Pis][2]. And a giant game of Jenga and giant Connect 4. Anything to get you in the playful mood.

Before I left there were already robots being made and sample projects making use of Raspberry Pi input/output pins.

Can't wait to find out which projects will be the judges (who are 9-11 years old) favourites tomorrow. Good luck to everyone trying to win the prizes!
