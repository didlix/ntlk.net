My favourite thing to do in Minecraft is to build things. I used to either keep hacking the inventory or give myself resources 64 blocks at a time while on the server. Since 1.8 update I got my mojo back, as I can just switch on the Creative mode while in Multiplayer. It gives you unlimited blocks and you can fly. I couldn't ask for more.
