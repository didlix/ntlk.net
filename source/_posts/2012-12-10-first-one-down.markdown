I've run my first session of Creative Coding workshop with 2nd year Design students at Goldsmiths today. I wanted to give the group a good intro to web technologies, because apart from them being useful for making cool things with I am convinced most people will need them at one point or another.

The short course will cover HTML, CSS and JavaScript (let's be honest, with a huge dollop of jQuery), in the last couple of days focusing on using APIs to get interesting things from other places and then doing something with thise things.

I've built a quick site for collecting all the notes, materials and additional resources in one place, you can [find it here][1]. It's [CC licensed][4], so feel free to use it, adapt it, or [contribute to making it better][2].

Today we've focussed on HTML, and I've started by showing the group Mozilla's [X-Ray Goggles][3], which always inevitably turns into defacing the BBC website:
