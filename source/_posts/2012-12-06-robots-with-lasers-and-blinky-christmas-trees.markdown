I had brilliant fun last night at the Bling My Card workshop. Some very nice people came and made really awesome cards. We had mulled wine and some mince pies. I managed to get conductive paint all over myself, luckily avoiding getting it on my face. 

So far we've raised Â£148 (not counting the donation box which will get counted next week). The [Lighthouse][1] team made it all possible, and they have generously let us use the space, and even decorated a tree for us!

If you want to see the cards, I have put all the pictures up on [Flickr][2].
