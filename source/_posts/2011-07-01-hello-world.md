While still at university I kept a blog entitled [Robots Against Routine][RAR] (or RAR for short) to document the progress of my final undergraduate project. Writing stuff down really helps to clarify and analyse your process and thinking, so I want to carry on doing it. 

I'd like [RAR][] to remain a historical document, so I'm starting this blog to keep my new writing separate. This is the place where I will talk about my new projects, [interaction design][id] and [physical computing][pc]. 

I haven't enabled comments yet. If you'd like to talk to me about something, get in touch by [email][] or [Twitter][]. If your reply makes for an interesting discussion I'll ask for your permission to publish it here.
