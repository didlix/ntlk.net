      <h2><a href="/2013/01/10/photocommunicating">Photocommunicating</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">January 10, 2013</h3>
      <p>All good things come to pass, and so has this: <a href='http://asburyandasbury.typepad.com/blog/2012/12/instagram-didnt-get-the-tone-wrong.html'>Instagram will now be sharing data with Facebook and can use metadata associated with your images, and/or your likeness and profile information in experimental advertising that may masquerade as no advertising at all</a>.</p>

<p>Many of my friends left the service already, and I am considering doing the same. But this isn&#8217;t the Why I Left Instagram post (I have deleted my account once before and haven&#8217;t written about it then either – can I haz gold star now?). The change in Instagram&#8217;s TOC got me thinking about what it was that I actually <em>liked</em> about the service, and whether those things would be more important to me that the consequences of my grumpy face endorsing brands without my consent or renumeration.</p>

<p>When I first started using it, there were no public profiles on the web. You could see photos but only from the app, or if they were explicitly shared to other places. It meant that I could have a mostly private account, and only my friends and people I like on the web had the chance to see such wonderful visual treats like the penis-shaped mince pie or a picture of my mate&#8217;s flatmate bathing on holiday. It seemed to me like sharing a photo on Instagram was a temporary means of visual communication; an off-hand joke; a shared moment. I don&#8217;t think I have ever scrolled through anyone&#8217;s photo archive, and I don&#8217;t know if other people do, but for me it was all about being in the moment and later forgetting it.</p>

<p>But of course nothing is forgotten, this is after all the internet. I was reminded of that when the public profiles were introduced and I realised that this fleeting thing I liked so much didn&#8217;t exist in the first place. I may have as well been uploading photos to Flickr, which I used to treat almost like GitHub for photos: put there everything you&#8217;re proud of, everything that might be useful in the future, everything you absolutely must have another backup of and everything that other people might need. It was like a browsable archive of all the useful things. It didn&#8217;t ever <em>feel</em> like an immediate communication tool.</p>

<p>Dustin Curtis speaks about photography as communication beautifully in his post &#8221;<a href='http://dcurt.is/photos-for-communication'>Photography&#8217;s Third Act</a>&#8221;. He tells the story of Treehouse, a photo sharing app that in its infancy had only one feature: sharing photos. No comments. No likes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of taking photos to maintain memories, we used them for instantaneous communication. (<a href='http://dcurt.is/photos-for-communication'>Photography&#8217;s Third Act</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me this was the difference between things I would post to Flickr (memories, records) and Instagram (communication) – obviously that&#8217;s not necessarily representative of other users on each platform.</p>

<p>Tools have the potential to frame how we use them, and so Treehouse changed how people used it to its own detriment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was an awesome experience, and I loved the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>That is, until liking, comments, and titles were added. Everyone wanted and begged for those features, of course, but adding them had an unforeseeable negative side effect: they removed the expectation that photos should be used for communication, and instead gave the impression that communication should happen around the photos. (<a href='http://dcurt.is/photos-for-communication'>Photography&#8217;s Third Act</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was pondering this and realised there isn&#8217;t a service I use that allows this kind of instant communication that eventually leaves not trace, like a conversation that you have one day but next week struggle to recall. And I would like that.</p>

<p>And apparently, so would others. <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapchat/id447188370?mt=8'>Snapchat</a> is a real-time image chat, and the images you send to one another disappear quickly. It became so popular that Facebook released their own <a href='http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/21/tech/social-media/facebook-poke-app/'>Poke</a> to grab a piece of the self-destructing-photo market.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t mind the photos staying out there for a bit longer, maybe until the next one is shared. So I&#8217;ve made <a href='http://instanat.ntlk.net/'>instanat</a> (no need to laugh, I had always been upfront about my inability to name things). It&#8217;s my own photo sharing thing. I have a special folder in my Dropbox where I can add new photos, and then they end up on the web. Only one at the time, visible until I post another one.</p>

<p>The integration with Dropbox means I can post to it from a variety of photo apps, even if they don&#8217;t save directly to Dropbox. I can drop in photos and screenshots from my laptop as well.</p>

<p>I am interested to see how this will shape what I deem shareable and how I will use it, knowing that despite being fleeting-<em>ish</em><sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> it&#8217;s all completely public. We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>
<p>It&#8217;s not quite fleeting though. Because it&#8217;s just me, photos don&#8217;t get the opportunity to disappear among others in your feed over time. I am lost for a better word to describe it though.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2013/01/03/samson-and-goliath">Samson and Goliath</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">January 03, 2013</h3>
      <p><img alt='Goliath by Calotype46' src='http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1040/5186857260_4e92c9e36e_z.jpg' /> <em>Harland &amp; Wolff Gantry Crane, Goliath, Queen&#8217;s Island, Belfast by <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/calotype46/5186857260/'>Calotype46</a></em></p>

<p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_and_Goliath_(cranes)'>Samson and Goliath</a> are huge shipbuilding gantry cranes in Belfast. I have fallen in love with them as soon as I saw them because they remind me of my home town, Szczecin. Szczecin&#8217;s shipyard also had two huge yellow gantry cranes towering over the city, always there in the background to orientate yourself by.</p>

<p><img alt='Gantry crane in Szczecin, Poland, by ilm19' src='http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2389/2165943514_1f1eed3455_z.jpg?zz=1' /> <em>Gantry crane in Szczecin, Poland, by <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/ilm19/2165943514/sizes/z/'>ilm19</a></em></p>

<p>I have come across reports that the Szczecin&#8217;s cranes are up for sale, and may leave my home town in due course. I don&#8217;t know how much of this is true, but this is still heartbreaking news. A gantry crane in Ulsan in South Korea <a href='http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aDm.5.mEHJnU'>has been named <em>Tears of Malmö</em></a> after the sadness caused by the crane being sold and removed from its place of origin, Malmö, where it has lived for 28 years. I hope Szczecin&#8217;s cranes will be named <em>Tears of Szczecin</em> if they leave home.</p>

<p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szczecin_Shipyard'>Stocznia Szczecińska</a> (Szczecin Shipyard) has changed hands multiple times, beginning straight after the WWII when Szczecin (formerly Stettin) when the whole region was taken over by Poland. In 2009 it has been shut down and its liquidation has begun.</p>

<p><img alt='Down with the decaying ruling elite' src='/images/szczecin2.jpg' /> <em>Banner hanging off shipyard&#8217;s railing, reading &#8220;Down with the decaying ruling elite&#8221;, photo from <a href='http://www.grudzien70.ipn.gov.pl/portal/g70/240/1671/17_XII_1970_r_czwartek.html'>IPN</a></em></p>

<p>The shipyards in Poland were one of the places where resistance to communist dictatorship began forming. In December 1970 at Stocznia Szczecińska the workers protested about the rising food prices and &#8220;surrounding reality&#8221; (as did workers of other shipyards in the country), a protest to which the state reacted with violence, killing sixteen people and injuring over a hundred just in Szczecin. Near the shipyard&#8217;s entrance there&#8217;s a monument with the names of the killed.</p>

<p><img alt='Tank in front of the railway station in Szczecin' src='/images/szczecin1.jpg' /> <em>Tank in front of the railway station in Szczecin, photo from <a href='http://www.grudzien70.ipn.gov.pl/portal/g70/240/1671/17_XII_1970_r_czwartek.html'>IPN</a></em></p>

<p>The industry is moving away, taking with it its most valuable remnants and only leaving a gaping hole.</p>

<p>Samson and Goliath, on the other hand, were &#8220;scheduled as historic monuments under Article 3 of the Historic Monuments and Archaeological Objects (Northern Ireland) Order 1995&#8221; (source: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_and_Goliath_(cranes)'>Wikipedia</a>) which means they are there to stay.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t find the names of the cranes in Szczecin, and I&#8217;m not even sure they have any. I wish they were as loved in their home place as the Samson and Goliath are.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2013/01/01/hello-2013">Hello 2013</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">January 01, 2013</h3>
      <p>2012 started off well – I had a great job I enjoyed, working with <a href='http://webponce.com'>Webponce</a>. We spent plenty of time on non-commercial and speculative projects. I had the best job title (Near-Futures Explorer, since you ask), awesome boss, and flexible working practices.</p>

<p>In April I&#8217;ve left this job (not without a great deal of sadness) to become a technologist in residence at <a href='http://lighthouse.org.uk'>Lighthouse</a> as part of <a href='http://happenstanceproject.com/'>Happenstance</a>, which resulted in building <a href='http://offbott.com'>Offbott</a> with <a href='http://booktwo.org/'>James Bridle</a> and <a href='http://fcc.ntlk.net/'>running workshops teaching to code</a>.</p>

<p>I have been taking on freelance work since second year at university, but after Happenstance I decided to do it full-time. Having been spoilt by having so much freedom in my working arrangements it seemed like the best thing to do. It meant I had the chance to work with <a href='http://wearecaper.com/'>Caper</a> on exciting cultural projects such as <a href='http://alarumproject.com/'>Alarum</a> for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, and with <a href='http://storythings.com/'>Storythings</a> on building interactive things.</p>

<p>During Happenstance sharing my skills turned out to be both enjoyable and educational, so I was keen to continue doing it. I ran a short <a href='http://2012.brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/event/schools-workshop-with-natalia-buckley/'>game-making workshop</a> for local secondary school students as a part of Lighthouse&#8217;s educational programme for <a href='http://2012.brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/'>Brighton Digital Festival</a>. The year has finished with a <a href='http://ntlk.github.com/creative-coding-2012/'>coding workshop</a> I did with <a href='http://www.gold.ac.uk/design/'>Goldsmiths</a> design students, who were on the same <a href='http://goldsmithsdesignblog.com/'>course</a> I graduated from.</p>

<p>I was able to devote some time to helping organise <a href='http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/'>Brighton Mini Maker Faire</a> which took place in September. I&#8217;ve invited <a href='http://infovore.org/'>Tom Armitage</a>, <a href='http://www.wonderlandblog.com/'>Alice Taylor</a>, <a href='http://berglondon.com/studio/matt-webb/'>Matt Webb</a>, <a href='http://lindasandvik.info/'>Linda Sandvik</a> representing <a href='http://www.codeclub.org.uk/'>Code Club</a>, <a href='http://finalbullet.com/'>Leila Johnston</a> and students from Cavendish School to talk at the event about their approach to making things. Afterwards I swore I wouldn&#8217;t organise events anymore as it&#8217;s exhausting, but I quickly forgot about that and organised <a href='http://blingmycard.ntlk.net/'>Bling My Card</a> workshop together with Lighthouse to raise money for <a href='http://www.rockinghorse.org.uk/'>Rockinghorse</a>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year I got inspired by the idea of &#8221;<a href='http://revdancatt.com/2010/09/25/blogging-like-its-2004/'>blogging like it&#8217;s 2004</a>&#8221; so I have been trying to be a lot less precious with my blog posts. I am hoping this is going to have a ripple effect on my personal projects so I will be talking about them more even if they are unfinished and imperfect. If I did the New Year resolution thing that would be one of them, but I don&#8217;t, so let&#8217;s leave it at that.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2012/12/16/notes-from-the-coding-workshop-at-goldsmiths">Notes from the coding workshop at Goldsmiths</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">December 16, 2012</h3>
      <p>On Friday I have finished <a href='http://ntlk.github.com/creative-coding-2012/'>teaching coding</a> to <a href='http://goldsmithsdesignblog.com/'>design</a> students at <a href='http://www.gold.ac.uk/design/'>Goldsmiths</a>.</p>

<p>What I really wanted to teach was how to get data from various places on the web and how you can manipulate the data to make it become something else. I realised that the least amount of time spent on setting up would be if I did that by introducing JavaScript, since everyone has it available in the browser (by that I mean the students and not <em>actually</em> everyone). I would have loved showing them Ruby, but they were using their own computers I didn&#8217;t want to risk a situation where I would spend an hour debugging someone&#8217;s Ruby installation going awry and possibly putting them off ever trying programming after such an unfortunate start. Only a couple of students have had any programming experience: one of them played with Processing before, another with C.</p>

<p>To start with JavaScript I had to start with HTML. I am of the view that <em>everyone</em> should be able to read and write HTML, and so it seemed to make sense to go through HTML, CSS and JavaScript all together (some course notes and links are <a href='http://ntlk.github.com/creative-coding-2012/'>all collected on the course site</a> on GitHub if you were interested in the structure of the course). I have seen people having to learn these basics (or at least the first two) in completely unrelated jobs, so hopefully these skills will come in handy even if the students don&#8217;t all end up pursuing coding as a hobby or in their creative work.</p>

<p><img alt='Visual Twitter' src='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8499/8274548508_3460a02d10_z.jpg' /> <em>Visual Twitter</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve learnt loads by teaching, and all these things seem so <em>obvious</em> now.</p>

<h3 id='teaching_css_is_hard'>Teaching CSS is hard.</h3>

<p>I have spent the first day explaining how the web works, and what is hypertext, and why all of this is worth knowing. I showed that browser is just a fancy way of viewing text files sent over the internet and how it will display your pages even if you litter them with mistakes. We then spent some time investigating various tags, editing code on existing websites and finally moved on to build a sample page or two in HTML before we dived into CSS.</p>

<p>Then we got to CSS. I had tried to make it as simple as possible and only teach the basics, but there is no way of getting away from explaining inheritance, specificity, the box model and floats. The fact that the structure of the CSS document wasn&#8217;t a one-to-one mapping of the underlying HTML structure was also confusing.</p>

<p>Very quickly I had to show some of them the <a href='http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/'>clearfix</a> hack, and I struggled to explain float clearing in a way that made sense. It also wasn&#8217;t very reassuring when I explained that I start almost every project from including this workaround.</p>

<h3 id='javascript_is_easier_than_css'>JavaScript is easier than CSS.</h3>

<p>Okay, maybe trolling <em>a little</em>. JavaScript is easier <em>to teach</em> than CSS. Especially when using jQuery.</p>

<p>I did what I now think of as group programming, which is a slightly expanded version of pair programming (I&#8217;m sure I haven&#8217;t invented it and it&#8217;s a popular way of teaching to program, but as I lack formal education in this regard I haven&#8217;t come across anything like that before).</p>

<p>I was writing the code projected on the wall while explaining what I&#8217;m doing and why, and the students followed. The little project we were working on was slowly increasing in complexity, and I kept introducing new things as we needed them. As we progressed new questions were arising. This seemed to work very well and we managed to make two small projects on the first day.</p>

<p>The next day we were working on visual Twitter: getting tweets via Twitter API and then fetching photos from Flickr matching the words in the tweet. By the end of the session one of the students said she could now read code and know what it did. I think they&#8217;ve become a lot more comfortable with JavaScript than they did with CSS.</p>

<h3 id='i_took_a_wrong_approach_to_teaching_css'>I took a wrong approach to teaching CSS.</h3>

<p>My understanding of positioning, floats, box-model and the cascade stems from playing with CSS over the years. So I thought that the best way to grow to understand these things is to talk about them for a little bit and then to play with them. I have prepared a sample page with some CSS applied that forms a base for trying some of the things without having to write everything from scratch. I also encouraged students to write CSS for the page they made to solve some real problems and challenges. Turns out that perhaps this wasn&#8217;t the best and least confusing way.</p>

<p>I think I could get much better results if I approached CSS in the way I did JavaScript and group-coded a sample project that would gradually increase in complexity. Building up confidence in using the language in that way is just as useful as building up the skill.</p>

<h3 id='a_lot_of_things_i_take_for_granted_about_developing_for_the_web_dont_make_sense_to_a_newcomer'>A lot of things I take for granted about developing for the web don&#8217;t make sense to a newcomer.</h3>

<p>The separation between HTML, CSS and JavaScript, what they are used for and differences in syntax is something I don&#8217;t think about until I have to explain them. To my students it was an odd thing to start with, as they are used to creating documents in a different way. I hope that by the end of the course it made sense why it&#8217;s a good idea to separate content from presentation and how are markup and programming different.</p>

<p>Some things made me a little bit embarrassed: the fact that we have to paper over browser inconsistencies with workarounds, that we have to provide fallback for audio and video, and that there aren&#8217;t simpler ways of doing things like layout (well, not reliably across browsers yet). They seem like such simple, straightforward things.</p>

<p>The group I was working with was pretty much evenly split with regards to gender, which obviously made me very happy. It was a pleasure working with all of them. Once we finished, one of the students told me that before the course that he thought coding was hard; now he doesn&#8217;t. I call that a success.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve run my first session of Creative Coding workshop with 2nd year Design students at Goldsmiths today. I wanted to give the group a good intro to web technologies, because apart from them being useful for making cool things with I am convinced most people will need them at one point or another.</p>

<p>The short course will cover HTML, CSS and JavaScript (let&#8217;s be honest, with a huge dollop of jQuery), in the last couple of days focusing on using APIs to get interesting things from other places and then doing something with thise things.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve built a quick site for collecting all the notes, materials and additional resources in one place, you can <a href='http://ntlk.github.com/creative-coding-2012/'>find it here</a>.

<p>Today we&#8217;ve focussed on HTML, and I&#8217;ve started by showing the group Mozilla&#8217;s <a href='http://hackasaurus.org/en-US/goggles/'>X-Ray Goggles</a>, which always inevitably turns into defacing the BBC website:</p>
