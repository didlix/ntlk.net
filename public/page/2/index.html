<p>I had brilliant fun last night at the Bling My Card workshop. Some very nice people came and made really awesome cards. We had mulled wine and some mince pies. I managed to get conductive paint all over myself, luckily avoiding getting it on my face.</p>

<p>So far we&#8217;ve raised £148 (not counting the donation box which will get counted next week). The <a href="http://lighthouse.org.uk/">Lighthouse</a> team made it all possible, and they have generously let us use the space, and even decorated a tree for us!</p>

<p>If you want to see the cards, I have put all the pictures up on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natalia_buckley/sets/72157632184258650/">Flickr</a>.</p>

      <p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8231319326_178f198fc5_z.jpg" alt="Conductive paint slowly drying" /></p>

<p>I was testing different circuits with conductive paint in preparation for the <a href="http://blingmycard.ntlk.net/">Bling My Card</a> workshop/party next week. I wanted to see if the circuits can be incorporated into card designs, and if so, how complex they could get.</p>

<p>In short: not complex at all - especially when it&#8217;s important they need to be debugged easily while drinking mulled wine. In the case of the reindeer card below it was tricky to figure out what went wrong: too many lines, not enough paint, a stray connection somewhere&#8230; As there could be many attendees who have never done any electronics before it will be best to keep things that can go wrong to a minimum and keep circuits very simple.</p>

<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8231285190_91238fed41_z.jpg" alt="A failed card" /></p>

<p>I also found out that paint applied as a thin layer with a thick brush didn&#8217;t work so well. The card below was one of the failures. I could tell with a multimeter that a current was passing through the paint, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to light up the LED. The paint lines need to be fairly narrow and thick - that kind of application definitely worked best.</p>

<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8206/8230248589_5b776c6291_z.jpg" alt="Paint applied to thinly doesn't work very well" /></p>

<p>Now, the drying bit. Some <a href="http://www.bareconductive.com/tutorials">Bare Conductive tutorials</a> say the paint will take about 10 mins to dry, but I&#8217;ve found it takes a bit longer, possibly even up to an hour, when applied this thickly.</p>

<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8205/8231366722_4e8e8b13da_z.jpg" alt="The LED slowly coming up" />
<em>The LED slowly getting brighter</em></p>

<p>The circuits without switches were ultimately a lot more rewarding, as you could keep checking if the LED is on yet, argue about whether it is, and observe it become noticeably brighter every time you look at it. The paint becomes more conductive as it dries, so when you first apply it it&#8217;s hard to tell if you&#8217;ve done it right. Switches were a little bit less fun, as you got to wait for them to dry almost fully before you can test them. On the other hand the switch will make your battery last longer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/card2.gif" alt="The next morning" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got to make a couple of nice sample cards to show what they could look like. If you&#8217;d like to make some with me and you&#8217;re free on the 5th December, you should <a href="http://blingmycard.ntlk.net/">come to the workshop</a>.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2012/11/21/bling-my-card">Bling my card</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">November 21, 2012</h3>
      <p>Some time back I have been working with <a href="http://wearecaper.com/">Caper</a> on a project which led me to the discovery of <a href="http://www.bareconductive.com/">Bare Conductive&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.bareconductive.com/bare-paint-1">conductive paint</a>. I got very excited at the prospect of being able to do a gentle introduction into the world of electronics though a very inviting medium of making a mess on paper with the tools you already know how to use.</p>

<p>Bare Conductive were one of the sponsors of the <a href="http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/">Brighton Mini Maker Faire</a> this year, and I briefly spoke to them - they are very nice people. I hope this post doesn&#8217;t sound like an advertiorial, but really, I only have positive things to say about possibilities it creates in making and teaching electronics. I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://www.bareconductive.com/bare-conductive-card-kit">Bare&#8217;s card making kits</a>, and whilst simple and fun to make, they introduce some very basic concepts of electronics with no effort at all.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.bareconductive.com/file/2012-09-27-img-2375-jpg" alt="Bare Conductive's Robot Card Kit" />
<em>One of the Robot Card Kits Bare Conductive Make, photo from <a href="http://www.bareconductive.com/">Bare Conductive</a></em></p>

<p>So to try out infecting a large number of people with a making and tinkering bug, I will be running a <a href="http://blingmycard.ntlk.net/">half-party, half-workshop making Christmas cards</a> with some LEDS in (aptly named <a href="http://blingmycard.ntlk.net/">Bling My Card</a> - thanks <a href="http://www.deanvipond.com/">Dean</a>). Guaranteed to put you in a festive mood. It&#8217;s on 5th December, from 6pm to 8pm, and <a href="http://blingmycard.eventbrite.co.uk/">tickets are £12</a> - this covers the cost of the materials, and any profit goes to <a href="http://rockinghorse.org.uk/">Rockinghorse</a>. That, and you get the become a part of an experiment which will test how many people I can infect with a new hobby in a single evening.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not in Brighton or are busy you can <a href="http://www.bareconductive.com/christmas-card-kit-tutorial">make some awesome cards</a> on your own: Bare have prepared a very thorough <a href="http://www.bareconductive.com/christmas-card-kit-tutorial">tutorial</a> explaining everything you need to know (which is very little).</p>

<p>Of course, conductive paint lends itself to so much more than cardmaking, which is what I would like to play with once I get some spare time again. There are folks working on some interesting innovative projects that benefit from the tactile quality of making bendable circuits on paper.</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/user1899679">Antonio Gomes</a> made an interface that uses the paint and conductive gloves to control music.</p>

<p>Remember me getting <a href="2012/09/14/sensing-activity-in-royal-shakespeare-theatre/">all excited about installing sensors around the Royal Shakespeare Theatre</a>? The commission I have been working on with <a href="http://wearecaper.com/">Caper</a> has been <a href="http://myshakespeare.worldshakespearefestival.org.uk/gallery/alarum-by-natalia-buckley-and-caper/">unveiled yesterday</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://alarumproject.com/">Alarum</a> is an ambient visualisation of the data showing changes in sound levels and motion around the theatre building.</p>

<p>The data often comes in every twenty to thirty seconds, depending on sensors&#8217; connectivity, so it needs to be analysed to decide which changes in sounds and motion level are meaningful.</p>

<p><a href="http://alarumproject.com/">Alarum</a> looks at average levels of data it receives. When these suddenly increase, it knows something has happened. If they continue at higher levels, it means activities continue in this part of the theatre. It is interesting to see how these change depending on time of the day, and how they change over the course of days and weeks.</p>

<p><a href="https://cosm.com/feeds/72813">The raw data is available</a>, so you can build something with it yourself. It would be great to see other projects made that look at it in a different way. Alarum&#8217;s code is <a href="https://github.com/ntlk/heartbeat">on GitHub under the codename heartbeat</a>, though it&#8217;s so messy I am a bit embarassed to be sharing it.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2012/11/11/coding-for-beginners">Teaching coding to beginners</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">November 11, 2012</h3>
      <p>In September I ran <a href="http://lighthouse.org.uk/programme/schools-workshop-with-natalia-buckley">two workshops with year 10 students</a> here in Brighton, as part of <a href="http://lighthouse.org.uk/">Lighthouse</a>&#8217;s educational programme for <a href="http://2012.brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/">Brighton Digital Festival</a>. We made games in Scratch together. That was my first opportunity to work with people so young, and the difference sin their approach to learning, as opposed to adults I have shared my skills with, were quite interesting. As I am preparing creative coding workshops I&#8217;ll be running at <a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/">Goldsmiths</a> in December, and working on some <a href="http://www.codeclub.org.uk/">CodeClub</a> projects, I am having to think a lot about approach to teaching how to code.</p>

<p><img src="/images/scratch.jpg" alt="A game created by one of the students at Brighton Aldrige Community Academy" />
<em>A game created by one of the students at Brighton Aldrige Community Academy</em></p>

<p>With adults, I have focused on showing what&#8217;s possible with code, and trying to inspire them enough to make overcoming the first period of learning a bit less of a daunting task. I assumed that as non-technical audience they may see learning programming as very difficult. It&#8217;s certainly how I saw it to start with, but I kept at it despite failing to grasp concepts and finding syntax of some of the languages unintuitive. I did so because I knew what awaited me: the power to create something, anything, out of nothing. The only barrier was my willingness to stick it out. I hoped similar approach could work for others.</p>

<p>Kids, on the other hand, did not need to be inspired or encouraged to try something new and tricky. They just did. We were building games using Scratch, which makes learning to code more accessible in many ways. First of all, it&#8217;s a visual environment, where it’s easy to snap commands together, nest them or move them around. Secondly, all possible commands are visible, so when you’re stuck it’s easy to peruse them and maybe find something suitable. Thirdly, it has a built in collection of sounds and images that can be used in games or application. It&#8217;s a breeze to get started.</p>

<p>In one of the sessions with kids I had a very small group, so I was able to let them do whatever they wanted and help each one of them separately. They all made different games, and I could adapt how I explain things based on their projects. I was there to get them started and guide them when they got stuck, but they honestly needed no encouragement whatsoever. Before I knew it they have explored the possibilities of Scratch beyond what I was able to cover and amazed me with their ingenuity and creativity.</p>

<p>With adult beginners though my primary focus is on encouraging that playful approach. My aim was never to prepare for the glamorous life of a programmer, or to teach a specific language in depth (not that I know any one of them that well), but rather to foster the same kind of hacker mentality that I always found appealing: figuring out how things work, being able to learn anything by poking them and just trying things out. There’s a huge difference between career programming and coding as a hobby and I’m not so interested in the former.</p>

<p>Coding is a creative endeavour. As <a href="http://zedshaw.com/">Zed A. Shaw</a> wrote in <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">&#8220;Learn Python the hard way&#8221;</a>, &#8220;as an intellectual activity [programming] is the only art form that allows you to create interactive art. You can create projects that other people can play with, and you can talk to them indirectly. No other art form is quite this interactive. Movies flow to the audience in one direction. Paintings do not move. Code goes both ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>In school most people got to try drawing or playing instruments. Trying out code should sit in the same category: as a creative pursuit that you should at least try before you decide whether you like it or not. There is a huge drive now to get kids to do just that, whether it&#8217;s to give them skills required by the modern world or whether it&#8217;s about teaching creative ways of thinking. <a href="http://www.codeclub.org.uk/">CodeClub</a> is one of the initiatives that has the potential to not just show how much this is needed, but provides the solutions. Kids will be okay.</p>

<p>I am interested in the generation that sits between those who had BBC Micros at home and kids of today. It can be prohibitively expensive to just try it out. <a href="http://decoded.co/">Decoded</a> was a series of workshops which, <a href="http://decoded.co/testimonials/">judging by the feedback from their attendees</a>, were absolutely brilliant. However, with a price tag of over £500 it&#8217;s not something just anyone could do.</p>

<p>It is often said among programmers that all you need to learn is access to the internet, as you can find free books, tutorials and communities to ask questions – it&#8217;s all readily available. It&#8217;s true that there are many approaches to sharing the knowledge and the likelihood is that every learning style is catered for, but finding good resources and going it alone can be tricky.</p>

<p>Still, there is for example <a href="http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/">Don&#8217;t Fear the Internet</a>, a brilliant series of screencasts explaining HTML &amp; CSS in an approachable manner. There is <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy</a> which now has courses on several languages and allows users to build their own challenges and exercises. I have to say that I found some of them a little tedious and mechanical, though many beginners find them useful. <a href="http://www.good.is/">GOOD magazine</a> has recently launched it&#8217;s own <a href="http://cfg.good.is/home">web basics course</a>, with prizes for the most adept participants. There are more and more resources, and I think they are becoming easier to come across, but since I look out for these things I may be a little biased.</p>

<p>The most exciting space to watch right now is development of programming tools. <a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a> wrote an <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">absolutely superb essay</a> on improving the way people learn to code by improving those. He points out that getting beginners to randomly change numbers in short programs and thus figure out how it all works is absurd, and there should be better ways of knowing what the syntax means and how the program is executed step by step. It&#8217;s a long piece of writing, but it&#8217;s absolutely worth it and I wholeheartedly recommend <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">you read it</a>.</p>

<p>He spoke about it during a presentation he gave at <a href="http://2012.cusec.net/">CUSEC 2012</a>, and has shown a prototype of a tool that would make learning programming and creating with programming easier. To him it&#8217;s about having a direct connection to your creation, and allowing yourself to discover things through this immediacy.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/36579366?byline=0&amp;badge=0" width="600" height="337" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Having tools like this to show to beginners would be brilliant. Staring at code which you cannot understand can be intimidating in a way that playing with buttons, sliders and dials isn&#8217;t. Modern electronic instruments make it easy to just pick them up and start playing with them even if you lack any music knowledge, modern programming tools should do the same.</p>
