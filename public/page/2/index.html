      <h2><a href="/2012/11/11/coding-for-beginners">Teaching coding to beginners</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">November 11, 2012</h3>
      <p>In September I ran <a href="http://lighthouse.org.uk/programme/schools-workshop-with-natalia-buckley">two workshops with year 10 students</a> here in Brighton, as part of <a href="http://lighthouse.org.uk/">Lighthouse</a>&#8217;s educational programme for <a href="http://2012.brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/">Brighton Digital Festival</a>. We made games in Scratch together. That was my first opportunity to work with people so young, and the difference sin their approach to learning, as opposed to adults I have shared my skills with, were quite interesting. As I am preparing creative coding workshops I&#8217;ll be running at <a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/">Goldsmiths</a> in December, and working on some <a href="http://www.codeclub.org.uk/">CodeClub</a> projects, I am having to think a lot about approach to teaching how to code.</p>

<p><img src="/images/scratch.jpg" alt="A game created by one of the students at Brighton Aldrige Community Academy" />
<em>A game created by one of the students at Brighton Aldrige Community Academy</em></p>

<p>With adults, I have focused on showing what&#8217;s possible with code, and trying to inspire them enough to make overcoming the first period of learning a bit less of a daunting task. I assumed that as non-technical audience they may see learning programming as very difficult. It&#8217;s certainly how I saw it to start with, but I kept at it despite failing to grasp concepts and finding syntax of some of the languages unintuitive. I did so because I knew what awaited me: the power to create something, anything, out of nothing. The only barrier was my willingness to stick it out. I hoped similar approach could work for others.</p>

<p>Kids, on the other hand, did not need to be inspired or encouraged to try something new and tricky. They just did. We were building games using Scratch, which makes learning to code more accessible in many ways. First of all, it&#8217;s a visual environment, where it’s easy to snap commands together, nest them or move them around. Secondly, all possible commands are visible, so when you’re stuck it’s easy to peruse them and maybe find something suitable. Thirdly, it has a built in collection of sounds and images that can be used in games or application. It&#8217;s a breeze to get started.</p>

<p>In one of the sessions with kids I had a very small group, so I was able to let them do whatever they wanted and help each one of them separately. They all made different games, and I could adapt how I explain things based on their projects. I was there to get them started and guide them when they got stuck, but they honestly needed no encouragement whatsoever. Before I knew it they have explored the possibilities of Scratch beyond what I was able to cover and amazed me with their ingenuity and creativity.</p>

<p>With adult beginners though my primary focus is on encouraging that playful approach. My aim was never to prepare for the glamorous life of a programmer, or to teach a specific language in depth (not that I know any one of them that well), but rather to foster the same kind of hacker mentality that I always found appealing: figuring out how things work, being able to learn anything by poking them and just trying things out. There’s a huge difference between career programming and coding as a hobby and I’m not so interested in the former.</p>

<p>Coding is a creative endeavour. As <a href="http://zedshaw.com/">Zed A. Shaw</a> wrote in <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">&#8220;Learn Python the hard way&#8221;</a>, &#8220;as an intellectual activity [programming] is the only art form that allows you to create interactive art. You can create projects that other people can play with, and you can talk to them indirectly. No other art form is quite this interactive. Movies flow to the audience in one direction. Paintings do not move. Code goes both ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>In school most people got to try drawing or playing instruments. Trying out code should sit in the same category: as a creative pursuit that you should at least try before you decide whether you like it or not. There is a huge drive now to get kids to do just that, whether it&#8217;s to give them skills required by the modern world or whether it&#8217;s about teaching creative ways of thinking. <a href="http://www.codeclub.org.uk/">CodeClub</a> is one of the initiatives that has the potential to not just show how much this is needed, but provides the solutions. Kids will be okay.</p>

<p>I am interested in the generation that sits between those who had BBC Micros at home and kids of today. It can be prohibitively expensive to just try it out. <a href="http://decoded.co/">Decoded</a> was a series of workshops which, <a href="http://decoded.co/testimonials/">judging by the feedback from their attendees</a>, were absolutely brilliant. However, with a price tag of over £500 it&#8217;s not something just anyone could do.</p>

<p>It is often said among programmers that all you need to learn is access to the internet, as you can find free books, tutorials and communities to ask questions – it&#8217;s all readily available. It&#8217;s true that there are many approaches to sharing the knowledge and the likelihood is that every learning style is catered for, but finding good resources and going it alone can be tricky.</p>

<p>Still, there is for example <a href="http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/">Don&#8217;t Fear the Internet</a>, a brilliant series of screencasts explaining HTML &amp; CSS in an approachable manner. There is <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy</a> which now has courses on several languages and allows users to build their own challenges and exercises. I have to say that I found some of them a little tedious and mechanical, though many beginners find them useful. <a href="http://www.good.is/">GOOD magazine</a> has recently launched it&#8217;s own <a href="http://cfg.good.is/home">web basics course</a>, with prizes for the most adept participants. There are more and more resources, and I think they are becoming easier to come across, but since I look out for these things I may be a little biased.</p>

<p>The most exciting space to watch right now is development of programming tools. <a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a> wrote an <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">absolutely superb essay</a> on improving the way people learn to code by improving those. He points out that getting beginners to randomly change numbers in short programs and thus figure out how it all works is absurd, and there should be better ways of knowing what the syntax means and how the program is executed step by step. It&#8217;s a long piece of writing, but it&#8217;s absolutely worth it and I wholeheartedly recommend <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">you read it</a>.</p>

<p>He spoke about it during a presentation he gave at <a href="http://2012.cusec.net/">CUSEC 2012</a>, and has shown a prototype of a tool that would make learning programming and creating with programming easier. To him it&#8217;s about having a direct connection to your creation, and allowing yourself to discover things through this immediacy.</p>

<p>Having tools like this to show to beginners would be brilliant. Staring at code which you cannot understand can be intimidating in a way that playing with buttons, sliders and dials isn&#8217;t. Modern electronic instruments make it easy to just pick them up and start playing with them even if you lack any music knowledge, modern programming tools should do the same.</p>

      <h3 class="date">September 21, 2012</h3>
      <p>Apparently over 7000 people have visited Brighton Mini Maker Faire this years, so there&#8217;s a chance that if you live in Brighton you were one of them.</p>

<p><a href="http://zine.openrightsgroup.org/features/2012/brighton-mini-maker-faire">I&#8217;ve written a post</a> for the <a href="http://zine.openrightsgroup.org/">ORGZine</a> about what it is and what were my highlights, so I won&#8217;t repeat that here, instead I just wanted to thank everyone involved. The amazing makers who came to show their wonderful inventions, all other organisers, our tireless volunteers and of course, the generous speakers who came to share tips on their creative process.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve missed it, check out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/bmmf/">BMMF Flickr group</a> to see some of the projects on display.</p>

      <h3 class="date">September 14, 2012</h3>
      <p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8297/7918060170_84de124234_z.jpg" alt="Motion Sensor in the Swan Bar" />
<em>Noise level sensor in the Swan Bar</em></p>

<p>Together with <a href="http://wearecaper.com">Caper</a> I have also been working on a small art project for the RSC. We&#8217;ve been interested in working  with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Shakespeare_Theatre">building itself</a>. Visitors tend to come to Stratford-upon-Avon for the evening, enjoy the performance, perhaps some food and drinks, and head back, often on the next day. As well as the audience, there are also people working front of house, behind the bar, not to mention the three different acting troupes working on stage.</p>

<p>We wanted to explore the building as a whole, the total sum of effort and action that makes experiencing the performance possible; some of it behind the scenes. To do that, we wanted to put together an app that would analyse, visualise and display activity in the building as it happens.</p>

<p>But how do you measure activity? You could look at the amount of stuff made, amount of waste generated, or resources used up, but to measure life you have to measure its symptoms, like noise and movement. We wanted to put sensors in the theatre to make the often invisible efforts plain to see. To be able to say: at noon on Wednesdays the wardrobe rooms get very busy; that here is a sudden burst of activity backstage on Thursday morning when the set gets installed; that the bar is actually busiest on Monday nights.</p>

<p>I have prototyped two types of devices: motion and sound sensors. Both use Arduino Ethernet boards to send data to <a href="https://cosm.com/">Cosm</a>, which I am using both to make the feeds publicly accessible, and to set up triggers that will communicate with a web app built to analyse and visualise the data. I had thought of making my own Arduino-compatible boards to save money, but there simply wasn&#8217;t enough time to make that possible.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8453/7917442134_5fc67fd717_z.jpg" alt="Motion sensor device" />
<em>Motion sensor</em></p>

<p>The motion sensor devices are very straightforward: simply plug in an infrared motion detector in to start logging. The time it takes for the sensor to keep sending the signal about the detected movement can be adjusted. I add every positive reading to a counter, and send the total to Cosm every 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Sound sensors initially seemed trickier, though I only needed to measure the levels or determine that they are over a certain threshold. My first approach was to try and use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectric_sensor">piezos</a> positioned on the floor or frequently used flat areas (such as the bar) to detect surface vibrations. Piezos are sensors that can detect pressure and vibration (and thus sound) and are often used as guitar pickups. I found it very difficult to amplify the piezo signal enough to turn it into a sensitive sensor over a large area though.</p>

<p>This is of course possible. Another member of the local hackspace, <a href="http://hotchk155.blogspot.co.uk/">Jason Hotchkiss</a>, has built <a href="http://hotchk155.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/musical-ping-pong-tables-and.html">exactly the kind of sensitive piezo sensor</a> that I had been thinking about. He designed and built all the electronics that went into this <a href="https://vimeo.com/45745840">musical ping pong table</a>. I attempted to recreate Jason&#8217;s sensors, though I have used a completely different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier">op-amp</a> and my results didn&#8217;t come anywhere close.</p>

<p>Another approach I&#8217;ve tried was using an electret microphone with a <a href="http://tinkerlog.com/2007/05/20/cheap-sound-sensor-for-avr/">cheap DIY amplifier I found on Alex Weber&#8217;s blog</a>. This time I didn&#8217;t have the right transistor, and though I had some that <em>apparently</em> could be a substitute it still got me nowhere: readings were full of noise and their range wasn&#8217;t good enough. Though I have a huge range of completely random components lying around it turns out I don&#8217;t actually have much useful stuff. Also I still suck at analogue circuits.</p>

<p>As I waited for the right components to show up in the post, with the deadline fast approaching, I had to explore other options. A basic amplifier isn&#8217;t exactly very difficult, and the inability to actually get a working one made was making me very frustrated, but in the end I had to go for the off-the-shelf solution as I had to install the devices the very next day. I used Sparkfun&#8217;s electret mic with an amplifier on a breakout board, ready to simply plug in and play. Not only I am embarrassed at my failure to prototype something basic, but also at the fact that I am using components that are probably 8-10x more expensive than strictly necessary.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8180/7917689864_c40b54a5de_z.jpg" alt="First readings coming in" />
<em>First sensor readings coming in</em></p>

<p>But hey, the devices worked and that&#8217;s what matters, right? I&#8217;ve laser cut some dashing boxes to protect them, ready for the installation in situ. Motion ones were placed near Stage Door and in the Wigs &amp; Wardrobe department, sound ones in the Green Room and in Swan Bar.</p>

<p>Something I didn&#8217;t think about when prototyping the devices was giving them some way of communicating with their surroundings, namely reporting that they are connected and everything is fine, or that there is an error of some kind and they would need to be reset. The switch that allows resetting them would also be great to have on the outside of the box.</p>

<p>Another thing that I have only seriously considered while installing the devices was communicating what they do to people working at the theatre. I think I would have appreciated more time spent on location talking to people about the project, especially the fact that these aren&#8217;t cameras or recording devices - it&#8217;s impossible to know this just by glancing at them. It would have been impossible to speak to the entire 700 strong team though, so we&#8217;ve put up notes explaining a little bit about the project and displaying some sample data from Cosm. There must be a better approach to communicating their purpose and how they work though.</p>

<p>The sensors have been collecting data for nearly two weeks now. I&#8217;ve built a sample Rails app that is dealing with the interpretation of the readings, which need to be analysed and calibrated before going live.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://cosm.com/feeds/72813">see the data for yourself on Cosm</a> (formerly Pachube). I encourage you to pull it and do something interesting with it. I&#8217;d be very interested to see what else it can be used for.</p>

      <h3 class="date">August 21, 2012</h3>
      <p>If you live in or near Brighton, September is going to be like Christmas. No, wait, it&#8217;s going to be better than Christmas.</p>

<p>From 3rd of September you&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking you&#8217;ve suddenly found yourself in the middle of South by South… er… East<sup>*</sup>. Monday kicks off with <a href="http://reasonstobecreative.com/">Reasons to be Creative</a>, a 3 day conference/festival for artists, designers and coders.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s followed by <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/programme/improving-reality">Improving Reality</a> on Thursday, a one day conference discussing how new technologies change our understanding of the world.</p>

<p>After Improving Reality we&#8217;ve got <a href="http://brightonsf.adactio.com/">Brighton SF</a> on <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/3530719477?ref=ebtnebtckt">Thursday evening</a>, a panel discussion and readings from leading SF authors.</p>

<p>Then on Friday it&#8217;s <a href="http://2012.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct</a>: this year&#8217;s theme is &#8220;Playing With The Future&#8221;.</p>

<p>On Saturday the 8th <a href="http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/">Brighton Mini Maker Faire</a> opens its doors. It&#8217;s a one day celebration of all things made: arts, crafts, robotics, engineering, woodwork, electronics, science music and more. Last year&#8217;s Faire was so well received it has expanded a bit. This year we will have some <a href="http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/2012/08/21/introducing-the-speakers/">speaking sessions</a> from makers who will lift the lid on their creative process.</p>

<p>Speakers include <a href="http://www.makielab.com/who-we-are/">Alice Taylor</a> (also at <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/programme/improving-reality">Improving Reality</a>), <a href="http://berglondon.com/studio/matt-webb/">Matt Webb</a>, <a href="http://finalbullet.com/">Leila Johnston</a> (speaking at <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/programme/improving-reality">Improving Reality</a>), <a href="http://codeclub.org.uk/">Code Club</a>, <a href="http://infovore.org/">Tom Armitage</a> (also speaking at <a href="http://2012.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct</a>), and students from Cavendish School and Dorothy Stringer. It&#8217;s a free event starting at 3pm in the Founders Room of the Brighton Dome, so come in early to make sure you get a seat. Oh, did I mention it was free? Don&#8217;t miss it. <a href="http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/2012/08/21/introducing-the-speakers/">More details here</a>.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2012/05/25/a-few-thoughts-on-happenstance-so-far">A few thoughts on Happenstance so far</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">May 25, 2012</h3>
      <p>On Wednesday at the <a href="http://lighthouse.org.uk/">Lighthouse</a> we (the Lighthouse team + the <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com">Happenstance</a> residents &amp; organisers) held an Open House event, talking to our guests about some of the work me and <a href="http://shorttermmemoryloss.com/">James</a> have done on the project so far and what <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com">Happenstance</a> is all about.</p>

<p><img src="/images/oh1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Happenstance brings together technologists and arts organisations to infuse the latter with the technological understanding and innovative approaches of the former. Putting people together in the same room is a remarkably simple yet underrated idea. Running the experiment three times in three different organisations hopefully will show which parts of it can be replicated and which were just a fluke.</p>

<p>After the Lighthouse team have been using a tool for recording team processes me and James have built – <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com/say-hi-to-offbott/">Offbott</a> – for a while, I suggested doing daily stand-up meetings and banning email for internal communications, in the spirit of the <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">Agile manifesto</a>. It&#8217;s been interesting for me to find out this way exactly how everyone works and what their work involves, though of course I had hoped this would also prove equally interesting to everyone else.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8165/7261135608_64f960c24b.jpg" alt="Agile." /></p>

<p>Not everyone always works on the same projects together, and knowing what everyone else does and how they do it is useful. I would like to think I&#8217;ve contributed to the understanding the value of inspecting your processes and seeking ways to improve them through reflection and discussion.</p>

<p>The second (and last!) Open House even will be held on Tuesday 19 June at <a href="http://lighthouse.org.uk/">Lighthouse</a>. Do come along to hear more.</p>
