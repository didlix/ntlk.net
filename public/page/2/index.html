      <h3 class="date">December 08, 2012</h3>
      <p>Today I went to <a href='http://www.codeclub.org.uk/'>Code Club</a>&#8217;s Raspberry Pi hack day. The aim is to create some projects Code Club students could do with Rasberry Pis in their schools. I had to leave early, so I have utterly failed at making a cool project , I have however filled plenty of balloons with helium (probably the most important job of the day).</p>

<p><img alt='Balloons' src='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8065/8255050472_ed02dc34f7_z.jpg' /></p>

<p>There were slush puppies available.</p>

<p><img alt='Slush Puppies' src='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8213/8254105397_6f8f3ce886_z.jpg' /></p>

<p>And Play-Doh. And Jelly Beans. And of course a whole load of <a href='http://www.raspberrypi.org/'>Raspberry Pis</a>. And a giant game of Jenga and giant Connect 4. Anything to get you in the playful mood.</p>

<p><img alt='Raspberry Pis' src='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8342/8254013353_483864e4be_z.jpg' /></p>

<p>Before I left there were already robots being made and sample projects making use of Raspberry Pi input/output pins.</p>

<p><img alt='Sample project made in Scratch' src='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8344/8254043255_23e657518f_z.jpg' /></p>

<p>Can&#8217;t wait to find out which projects will be the judges (who are 9-11 years old) favourites tomorrow. Good luck to everyone trying to win the prizes!</p>

<p>I had brilliant fun last night at the Bling My Card workshop. Some very nice people came and made really awesome cards. We had mulled wine and some mince pies. I managed to get conductive paint all over myself, luckily avoiding getting it on my face.</p>

<p>So far we&#8217;ve raised £148 (not counting the donation box which will get counted next week). The <a href='http://lighthouse.org.uk/'>Lighthouse</a> team made it all possible, and they have generously let us use the space, and even decorated a tree for us!</p>

<p>If you want to see the cards, I have put all the pictures up on <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natalia_buckley/sets/72157632184258650/'>Flickr</a>.</p>

      <p><img alt='Conductive paint slowly drying' src='https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8231319326_178f198fc5_z.jpg' /></p>

<p>I was testing different circuits with conductive paint in preparation for the <a href='http://blingmycard.ntlk.net/'>Bling My Card</a> workshop/party next week. I wanted to see if the circuits can be incorporated into card designs, and if so, how complex they could get.</p>

<p>In short: not complex at all - especially when it&#8217;s important they need to be debugged easily while drinking mulled wine. In the case of the reindeer card below it was tricky to figure out what went wrong: too many lines, not enough paint, a stray connection somewhere&#8230; As there could be many attendees who have never done any electronics before it will be best to keep things that can go wrong to a minimum and keep circuits very simple.</p>

<p><img alt='A failed card' src='https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8231285190_91238fed41_z.jpg' /></p>

<p>I also found out that paint applied as a thin layer with a thick brush didn&#8217;t work so well. The card below was one of the failures. I could tell with a multimeter that a current was passing through the paint, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to light up the LED. The paint lines need to be fairly narrow and thick - that kind of application definitely worked best.</p>

<p><img alt='Paint applied to thinly doesnt work very well' src='https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8206/8230248589_5b776c6291_z.jpg' /></p>

<p>Now, the drying bit. Some <a href='http://www.bareconductive.com/tutorials'>Bare Conductive tutorials</a> say the paint will take about 10 mins to dry, but I&#8217;ve found it takes a bit longer, possibly even up to an hour, when applied this thickly.</p>

<p><img alt='The LED slowly coming up' src='https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8205/8231366722_4e8e8b13da_z.jpg' /> <em>The LED slowly getting brighter</em></p>

<p>The circuits without switches were ultimately a lot more rewarding, as you could keep checking if the LED is on yet, argue about whether it is, and observe it become noticeably brighter every time you look at it. The paint becomes more conductive as it dries, so when you first apply it it&#8217;s hard to tell if you&#8217;ve done it right. Switches were a little bit less fun, as you got to wait for them to dry almost fully before you can test them. On the other hand the switch will make your battery last longer.</p>

<p><img alt='The next morning' src='/images/card2.gif' /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got to make a couple of nice sample cards to show what they could look like. If you&#8217;d like to make some with me and you&#8217;re free on the 5th December, you should <a href='http://blingmycard.ntlk.net/'>come to the workshop</a>.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2012/11/21/bling-my-card">Bling my card</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">November 21, 2012</h3>
      <p>Some time back I have been working with <a href='http://wearecaper.com/'>Caper</a> on a project which led me to the discovery of <a href='http://www.bareconductive.com/'>Bare Conductive&#8217;s</a> <a href='http://www.bareconductive.com/bare-paint-1'>conductive paint</a>. I got very excited at the prospect of being able to do a gentle introduction into the world of electronics though a very inviting medium of making a mess on paper with the tools you already know how to use.</p>

<p>Bare Conductive were one of the sponsors of the <a href='http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/'>Brighton Mini Maker Faire</a> this year, and I briefly spoke to them - they are very nice people. I hope this post doesn&#8217;t sound like an advertiorial, but really, I only have positive things to say about possibilities it creates in making and teaching electronics. I&#8217;ve seen <a href='http://www.bareconductive.com/bare-conductive-card-kit'>Bare&#8217;s card making kits</a>, and whilst simple and fun to make, they introduce some very basic concepts of electronics with no effort at all.</p>

<p><img alt='Bare Conductives Robot Card Kit' src='http://www.bareconductive.com/file/2012-09-27-img-2375-jpg' /> <em>One of the Robot Card Kits Bare Conductive Make, photo from <a href='http://www.bareconductive.com/'>Bare Conductive</a></em></p>

<p>So to try out infecting a large number of people with a making and tinkering bug, I will be running a <a href='http://blingmycard.ntlk.net/'>half-party, half-workshop making Christmas cards</a> with some LEDS in (aptly named <a href='http://blingmycard.ntlk.net/'>Bling My Card</a> - thanks <a href='http://www.deanvipond.com/'>Dean</a>). Guaranteed to put you in a festive mood. It&#8217;s on 5th December, from 6pm to 8pm, and <a href='http://blingmycard.eventbrite.co.uk/'>tickets are £12</a> - this covers the cost of the materials, and any profit goes to <a href='http://rockinghorse.org.uk/'>Rockinghorse</a>. That, and you get the become a part of an experiment which will test how many people I can infect with a new hobby in a single evening.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not in Brighton or are busy you can <a href='http://www.bareconductive.com/christmas-card-kit-tutorial'>make some awesome cards</a> on your own: Bare have prepared a very thorough <a href='http://www.bareconductive.com/christmas-card-kit-tutorial'>tutorial</a> explaining everything you need to know (which is very little).</p>

<p>Of course, conductive paint lends itself to so much more than cardmaking, which is what I would like to play with once I get some spare time again. There are folks working on some interesting innovative projects that benefit from the tactile quality of making bendable circuits on paper.</p>

<p><a href='https://vimeo.com/user1899679'>Antonio Gomes</a> made an interface that uses the paint and conductive gloves to control music.</p>

<p>Remember me getting <a href='2012/09/14/sensing-activity-in-royal-shakespeare-theatre/'>all excited about installing sensors around the Royal Shakespeare Theatre</a>? The commission I have been working on with <a href='http://wearecaper.com/'>Caper</a> has been <a href='http://myshakespeare.worldshakespearefestival.org.uk/gallery/alarum-by-natalia-buckley-and-caper/'>unveiled yesterday</a>.</p>

<p><a href='http://alarumproject.com/'>Alarum</a> is an ambient visualisation of the data showing changes in sound levels and motion around the theatre building.</p>

<p>The data often comes in every twenty to thirty seconds, depending on sensors&#8217; connectivity, so it needs to be analysed to decide which changes in sounds and motion level are meaningful.</p>

<p><a href='http://alarumproject.com/'>Alarum</a> looks at average levels of data it receives. When these suddenly increase, it knows something has happened. If they continue at higher levels, it means activities continue in this part of the theatre. It is interesting to see how these change depending on time of the day, and how they change over the course of days and weeks.</p>

<p><a href='https://cosm.com/feeds/72813'>The raw data is available</a>, so you can build something with it yourself. It would be great to see other projects made that look at it in a different way. Alarum&#8217;s code is <a href='https://github.com/ntlk/heartbeat'>on GitHub under the codename heartbeat</a>, though it&#8217;s so messy I am a bit embarassed to be sharing it.</p>
