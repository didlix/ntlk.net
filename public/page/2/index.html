      <h2><a href="/2012/12/16/notes-from-the-coding-workshop-at-goldsmiths">Notes from the coding workshop at Goldsmiths</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">December 16, 2012</h3>
      <p>On Friday I have finished <a href='http://ntlk.github.com/creative-coding-2012/'>teaching coding</a> to <a href='http://goldsmithsdesignblog.com/'>design</a> students at <a href='http://www.gold.ac.uk/design/'>Goldsmiths</a>.</p>

<p>What I really wanted to teach was how to get data from various places on the web and how you can manipulate the data to make it become something else. I realised that the least amount of time spent on setting up would be if I did that by introducing JavaScript, since everyone has it available in the browser (by that I mean the students and not <em>actually</em> everyone). I would have loved showing them Ruby, but they were using their own computers I didn&#8217;t want to risk a situation where I would spend an hour debugging someone&#8217;s Ruby installation going awry and possibly putting them off ever trying programming after such an unfortunate start. Only a couple of students have had any programming experience: one of them played with Processing before, another with C.</p>

<p>To start with JavaScript I had to start with HTML. I am of the view that <em>everyone</em> should be able to read and write HTML, and so it seemed to make sense to go through HTML, CSS and JavaScript all together (some course notes and links are <a href='http://ntlk.github.com/creative-coding-2012/'>all collected on the course site</a> on GitHub if you were interested in the structure of the course). I have seen people having to learn these basics (or at least the first two) in completely unrelated jobs, so hopefully these skills will come in handy even if the students don&#8217;t all end up pursuing coding as a hobby or in their creative work.</p>

<p><img alt='Visual Twitter' src='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8499/8274548508_3460a02d10_z.jpg' /> <em>Visual Twitter</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve learnt loads by teaching, and all these things seem so <em>obvious</em> now.</p>

<h3 id='teaching_css_is_hard'>Teaching CSS is hard.</h3>

<p>I have spent the first day explaining how the web works, and what is hypertext, and why all of this is worth knowing. I showed that browser is just a fancy way of viewing text files sent over the internet and how it will display your pages even if you litter them with mistakes. We then spent some time investigating various tags, editing code on existing websites and finally moved on to build a sample page or two in HTML before we dived into CSS.</p>

<p>Then we got to CSS. I had tried to make it as simple as possible and only teach the basics, but there is no way of getting away from explaining inheritance, specificity, the box model and floats. The fact that the structure of the CSS document wasn&#8217;t a one-to-one mapping of the underlying HTML structure was also confusing.</p>

<p>Very quickly I had to show some of them the <a href='http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/'>clearfix</a> hack, and I struggled to explain float clearing in a way that made sense. It also wasn&#8217;t very reassuring when I explained that I start almost every project from including this workaround.</p>

<h3 id='javascript_is_easier_than_css'>JavaScript is easier than CSS.</h3>

<p>Okay, maybe trolling <em>a little</em>. JavaScript is easier <em>to teach</em> than CSS. Especially when using jQuery.</p>

<p>I did what I now think of as group programming, which is a slightly expanded version of pair programming (I&#8217;m sure I haven&#8217;t invented it and it&#8217;s a popular way of teaching to program, but as I lack formal education in this regard I haven&#8217;t come across anything like that before).</p>

<p>I was writing the code projected on the wall while explaining what I&#8217;m doing and why, and the students followed. The little project we were working on was slowly increasing in complexity, and I kept introducing new things as we needed them. As we progressed new questions were arising. This seemed to work very well and we managed to make two small projects on the first day.</p>

<p>The next day we were working on visual Twitter: getting tweets via Twitter API and then fetching photos from Flickr matching the words in the tweet. By the end of the session one of the students said she could now read code and know what it did. I think they&#8217;ve become a lot more comfortable with JavaScript than they did with CSS.</p>

<h3 id='i_took_a_wrong_approach_to_teaching_css'>I took a wrong approach to teaching CSS.</h3>

<p>My understanding of positioning, floats, box-model and the cascade stems from playing with CSS over the years. So I thought that the best way to grow to understand these things is to talk about them for a little bit and then to play with them. I have prepared a sample page with some CSS applied that forms a base for trying some of the things without having to write everything from scratch. I also encouraged students to write CSS for the page they made to solve some real problems and challenges. Turns out that perhaps this wasn&#8217;t the best and least confusing way.</p>

<p>I think I could get much better results if I approached CSS in the way I did JavaScript and group-coded a sample project that would gradually increase in complexity. Building up confidence in using the language in that way is just as useful as building up the skill.</p>

<h3 id='a_lot_of_things_i_take_for_granted_about_developing_for_the_web_dont_make_sense_to_a_newcomer'>A lot of things I take for granted about developing for the web don&#8217;t make sense to a newcomer.</h3>

<p>The separation between HTML, CSS and JavaScript, what they are used for and differences in syntax is something I don&#8217;t think about until I have to explain them. To my students it was an odd thing to start with, as they are used to creating documents in a different way. I hope that by the end of the course it made sense why it&#8217;s a good idea to separate content from presentation and how are markup and programming different.</p>

<p>Some things made me a little bit embarrassed: the fact that we have to paper over browser inconsistencies with workarounds, that we have to provide fallback for audio and video, and that there aren&#8217;t simpler ways of doing things like layout (well, not reliably across browsers yet). They seem like such simple, straightforward things.</p>

<p>The group I was working with was pretty much evenly split with regards to gender, which obviously made me very happy. It was a pleasure working with all of them. Once we finished, one of the students told me that before the course that he thought coding was hard; now he doesn&#8217;t. I call that a success.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve run my first session of Creative Coding workshop with 2nd year Design students at Goldsmiths today. I wanted to give the group a good intro to web technologies, because apart from them being useful for making cool things with I am convinced most people will need them at one point or another.</p>

<p>The short course will cover HTML, CSS and JavaScript (let&#8217;s be honest, with a huge dollop of jQuery), in the last couple of days focusing on using APIs to get interesting things from other places and then doing something with thise things.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve built a quick site for collecting all the notes, materials and additional resources in one place, you can <a href='http://ntlk.github.com/creative-coding-2012/'>find it here</a>. It&#8217;s <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/'>CC licensed</a>, so feel free to use it, adapt it, or <a href='https://github.com/ntlk/creative-coding-2012'>contribute to making it better</a>.</p>

<p>Today we&#8217;ve focussed on HTML, and I&#8217;ve started by showing the group Mozilla&#8217;s <a href='http://hackasaurus.org/en-US/goggles/'>X-Ray Goggles</a>, which always inevitably turns into defacing the BBC website:</p>

      <p>Today I went to <a href='http://www.codeclub.org.uk/'>Code Club</a>&#8217;s Raspberry Pi hack day. The aim is to create some projects Code Club students could do with Rasberry Pis in their schools. I had to leave early, so I have utterly failed at making a cool project , I have however filled plenty of balloons with helium (probably the most important job of the day).</p>

<p><img alt='Balloons' src='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8065/8255050472_ed02dc34f7_z.jpg' /></p>

<p>There were slush puppies available.</p>

<p><img alt='Slush Puppies' src='http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8213/8254105397_6f8f3ce886_z.jpg' /></p>

<p>And Play-Doh. And Jelly Beans. And of course a whole load of <a href='http://www.raspberrypi.org/'>Raspberry Pis</a>. And a giant game of Jenga and giant Connect 4. Anything to get you in the playful mood.</p>

<p>Before I left there were already robots being made and sample projects making use of Raspberry Pi input/output pins.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t wait to find out which projects will be the judges (who are 9-11 years old) favourites tomorrow. Good luck to everyone trying to win the prizes!</p>

<p>I had brilliant fun last night at the Bling My Card workshop. Some very nice people came and made really awesome cards. We had mulled wine and some mince pies. I managed to get conductive paint all over myself, luckily avoiding getting it on my face.</p>

<p>So far we&#8217;ve raised £148 (not counting the donation box which will get counted next week). The <a href='http://lighthouse.org.uk/'>Lighthouse</a> team made it all possible, and they have generously let us use the space, and even decorated a tree for us!</p>

<p>If you want to see the cards, I have put all the pictures up on <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/natalia_buckley/sets/72157632184258650/'>Flickr</a>.</p>

      <p><img alt='Conductive paint slowly drying' src='https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8231319326_178f198fc5_z.jpg' /></p>

<p>I was testing different circuits with conductive paint in preparation for the <a href='http://blingmycard.ntlk.net/'>Bling My Card</a> workshop/party next week. I wanted to see if the circuits can be incorporated into card designs, and if so, how complex they could get.</p>

<p>In short: not complex at all - especially when it&#8217;s important they need to be debugged easily while drinking mulled wine. In the case of the reindeer card below it was tricky to figure out what went wrong: too many lines, not enough paint, a stray connection somewhere&#8230; As there could be many attendees who have never done any electronics before it will be best to keep things that can go wrong to a minimum and keep circuits very simple.</p>

<p><img alt='A failed card' src='https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8231285190_91238fed41_z.jpg' /></p>

<p>I also found out that paint applied as a thin layer with a thick brush didn&#8217;t work so well. The card below was one of the failures. I could tell with a multimeter that a current was passing through the paint, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to light up the LED. The paint lines need to be fairly narrow and thick - that kind of application definitely worked best.</p>

<p><img alt='Paint applied to thinly doesnt work very well' src='https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8206/8230248589_5b776c6291_z.jpg' /></p>

<p>Now, the drying bit. Some <a href='http://www.bareconductive.com/tutorials'>Bare Conductive tutorials</a> say the paint will take about 10 mins to dry, but I&#8217;ve found it takes a bit longer, possibly even up to an hour, when applied this thickly.</p>

<p><img alt='The LED slowly coming up' src='https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8205/8231366722_4e8e8b13da_z.jpg' /> <em>The LED slowly getting brighter</em></p>

<p>The circuits without switches were ultimately a lot more rewarding, as you could keep checking if the LED is on yet, argue about whether it is, and observe it become noticeably brighter every time you look at it. The paint becomes more conductive as it dries, so when you first apply it it&#8217;s hard to tell if you&#8217;ve done it right. Switches were a little bit less fun, as you got to wait for them to dry almost fully before you can test them. On the other hand the switch will make your battery last longer.</p>

<p><img alt='The next morning' src='/images/card2.gif' /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got to make a couple of nice sample cards to show what they could look like. If you&#8217;d like to make some with me and you&#8217;re free on the 5th December, you should <a href='http://blingmycard.ntlk.net/'>come to the workshop</a>.</p>
