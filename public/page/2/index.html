<em>Noise level sensor in the Swan Bar</em></p>

<p>Together with <a href="http://wearecaper.com">Caper</a> I have also been working on a small art project for the RSC. We&#8217;ve been interested in working  with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Shakespeare_Theatre">building itself</a>. Visitors tend to come to Stratford-upon-Avon for the evening, enjoy the performance, perhaps some food and drinks, and head back, often on the next day. As well as the audience, there are also people working front of house, behind the bar, not to mention the three different acting troupes working on stage.</p>

<p>We wanted to explore the building as a whole, the total sum of effort and action that makes experiencing the performance possible; some of it behind the scenes. To do that, we wanted to put together an app that would analyse, visualise and display activity in the building as it happens.</p>

<p>But how do you measure activity? You could look at the amount of stuff made, amount of waste generated, or resources used up, but to measure life you have to measure its symptoms, like noise and movement. We wanted to put sensors in the theatre to make the often invisible efforts plain to see. To be able to say: at noon on Wednesdays the wardrobe rooms get very busy; that here is a sudden burst of activity backstage on Thursday morning when the set gets installed; that the bar is actually busiest on Monday nights.</p>

<p>I have prototyped two types of devices: motion and sound sensors. Both use Arduino Ethernet boards to send data to <a href="https://cosm.com/">Cosm</a>, which I am using both to make the feeds publicly accessible, and to set up triggers that will communicate with a web app built to analyse and visualise the data. I had thought of making my own Arduino-compatible boards to save money, but there simply wasn&#8217;t enough time to make that possible.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8453/7917442134_5fc67fd717_z.jpg" alt="Motion sensor device" />
<em>Motion sensor</em></p>

<p>The motion sensor devices are very straightforward: simply plug in an infrared motion detector in to start logging. The time it takes for the sensor to keep sending the signal about the detected movement can be adjusted. I add every positive reading to a counter, and send the total to Cosm every 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Sound sensors initially seemed trickier, though I only needed to measure the levels or determine that they are over a certain threshold. My first approach was to try and use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectric_sensor">piezos</a> positioned on the floor or frequently used flat areas (such as the bar) to detect surface vibrations. Piezos are sensors that can detect pressure and vibration (and thus sound) and are often used as guitar pickups. I found it very difficult to amplify the piezo signal enough to turn it into a sensitive sensor over a large area though.</p>

<p>This is of course possible. Another member of the local hackspace, <a href="http://hotchk155.blogspot.co.uk/">Jason Hotchkiss</a>, has built <a href="http://hotchk155.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/musical-ping-pong-tables-and.html">exactly the kind of sensitive piezo sensor</a> that I had been thinking about. He designed and built all the electronics that went into this <a href="https://vimeo.com/45745840">musical ping pong table</a>. I attempted to recreate Jason&#8217;s sensors, though I have used a completely different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier">op-amp</a> and my results didn&#8217;t come anywhere close.</p>

<p>Another approach I&#8217;ve tried was using an electret microphone with a <a href="http://tinkerlog.com/2007/05/20/cheap-sound-sensor-for-avr/">cheap DIY amplifier I found on Alex Weber&#8217;s blog</a>. This time I didn&#8217;t have the right transistor, and though I had some that <em>apparently</em> could be a substitute it still got me nowhere: readings were full of noise and their range wasn&#8217;t good enough. Though I have a huge range of completely random components lying around it turns out I don&#8217;t actually have much useful stuff. Also I still suck at analogue circuits.</p>

<p>As I waited for the right components to show up in the post, with the deadline fast approaching, I had to explore other options. A basic amplifier isn&#8217;t exactly very difficult, and the inability to actually get a working one made was making me very frustrated, but in the end I had to go for the off-the-shelf solution as I had to install the devices the very next day. I used Sparkfun&#8217;s electret mic with an amplifier on a breakout board, ready to simply plug in and play. Not only I am embarrassed at my failure to prototype something basic, but also at the fact that I am using components that are probably 8-10x more expensive than strictly necessary.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8180/7917689864_c40b54a5de_z.jpg" alt="First readings coming in" />
<em>First sensor readings coming in</em></p>

<p>But hey, the devices worked and that&#8217;s what matters, right? I&#8217;ve laser cut some dashing boxes to protect them, ready for the installation in situ. Motion ones were placed near Stage Door and in the Wigs &amp; Wardrobe department, sound ones in the Green Room and in Swan Bar.</p>

<p>Something I didn&#8217;t think about when prototyping the devices was giving them some way of communicating with their surroundings, namely reporting that they are connected and everything is fine, or that there is an error of some kind and they would need to be reset. The switch that allows resetting them would also be great to have on the outside of the box.</p>

<p>Another thing that I have only seriously considered while installing the devices was communicating what they do to people working at the theatre. I think I would have appreciated more time spent on location talking to people about the project, especially the fact that these aren&#8217;t cameras or recording devices - it&#8217;s impossible to know this just by glancing at them. It would have been impossible to speak to the entire 700 strong team though, so we&#8217;ve put up notes explaining a little bit about the project and displaying some sample data from Cosm. There must be a better approach to communicating their purpose and how they work though.</p>

<p>The sensors have been collecting data for nearly two weeks now. I&#8217;ve built a sample Rails app that is dealing with the interpretation of the readings, which need to be analysed and calibrated before going live.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://cosm.com/feeds/72813">see the data for yourself on Cosm</a> (formerly Pachube). I encourage you to pull it and do something interesting with it. I&#8217;d be very interested to see what else it can be used for.</p>

      <h3 class="date">August 21, 2012</h3>
      <p>If you live in or near Brighton, September is going to be like Christmas. No, wait, it&#8217;s going to be better than Christmas.</p>

<p>From 3rd of September you&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking you&#8217;ve suddenly found yourself in the middle of South by South… er… East<sup>*</sup>. Monday kicks off with <a href="http://reasonstobecreative.com/">Reasons to be Creative</a>, a 3 day conference/festival for artists, designers and coders.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s followed by <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/programme/improving-reality">Improving Reality</a> on Thursday, a one day conference discussing how new technologies change our understanding of the world.</p>

<p>After Improving Reality we&#8217;ve got <a href="http://brightonsf.adactio.com/">Brighton SF</a> on <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/3530719477?ref=ebtnebtckt">Thursday evening</a>, a panel discussion and readings from leading SF authors.</p>

<p>Then on Friday it&#8217;s <a href="http://2012.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct</a>: this year&#8217;s theme is &#8220;Playing With The Future&#8221;.</p>

<p>On Saturday the 8th <a href="http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/">Brighton Mini Maker Faire</a> opens its doors. It&#8217;s a one day celebration of all things made: arts, crafts, robotics, engineering, woodwork, electronics, science music and more. Last year&#8217;s Faire was so well received it has expanded a bit. This year we will have some <a href="http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/2012/08/21/introducing-the-speakers/">speaking sessions</a> from makers who will lift the lid on their creative process.</p>

<p>Speakers include <a href="http://www.makielab.com/who-we-are/">Alice Taylor</a> (also at <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/programme/improving-reality">Improving Reality</a>), <a href="http://berglondon.com/studio/matt-webb/">Matt Webb</a>, <a href="http://finalbullet.com/">Leila Johnston</a> (speaking at <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/programme/improving-reality">Improving Reality</a>), <a href="http://codeclub.org.uk/">Code Club</a>, <a href="http://infovore.org/">Tom Armitage</a> (also speaking at <a href="http://2012.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct</a>), and students from Cavendish School and Dorothy Stringer. It&#8217;s a free event starting at 3pm in the Founders Room of the Brighton Dome, so come in early to make sure you get a seat. Oh, did I mention it was free? Don&#8217;t miss it. <a href="http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/2012/08/21/introducing-the-speakers/">More details here</a>.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2012/05/25/a-few-thoughts-on-happenstance-so-far">A few thoughts on Happenstance so far</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">May 25, 2012</h3>
      <p>On Wednesday at the <a href="http://lighthouse.org.uk/">Lighthouse</a> we (the Lighthouse team + the <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com">Happenstance</a> residents &amp; organisers) held an Open House event, talking to our guests about some of the work me and <a href="http://shorttermmemoryloss.com/">James</a> have done on the project so far and what <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com">Happenstance</a> is all about.</p>

<p><img src="/images/oh1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Happenstance brings together technologists and arts organisations to infuse the latter with the technological understanding and innovative approaches of the former. Putting people together in the same room is a remarkably simple yet underrated idea. Running the experiment three times in three different organisations hopefully will show which parts of it can be replicated and which were just a fluke.</p>

<p>After the Lighthouse team have been using a tool for recording team processes me and James have built – <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com/say-hi-to-offbott/">Offbott</a> – for a while, I suggested doing daily stand-up meetings and banning email for internal communications, in the spirit of the <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">Agile manifesto</a>. It&#8217;s been interesting for me to find out this way exactly how everyone works and what their work involves, though of course I had hoped this would also prove equally interesting to everyone else.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8165/7261135608_64f960c24b.jpg" alt="Agile." /></p>

<p>Not everyone always works on the same projects together, and knowing what everyone else does and how they do it is useful. I would like to think I&#8217;ve contributed to the understanding the value of inspecting your processes and seeking ways to improve them through reflection and discussion.</p>

<p>The second (and last!) Open House even will be held on Tuesday 19 June at <a href="http://lighthouse.org.uk/">Lighthouse</a>. Do come along to hear more.</p>

      <h3 class="date">May 08, 2012</h3>
      <p><img src="/images/design_vacuum.png" alt="One does not simply design in a vacuum" /></p>

<p>Graduating from a design course at Goldsmiths bestowed me with a sense of power and a sense of responsibility. You don&#8217;t casually design stuff that will affect people&#8217;s lives without stopping first to think about it.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re finally collectively waking up to the fact that the tools of the future are largely software tools. I design and make digital things - they can sometimes seem like not real things at all. They appear so ethereal that my parents struggle to describe to friends and family what it is I do for a living. And yet with every design decision, every small feature, or lack of feature, or way of doing things - I know it can affect how people relate to one another. <a href="http://farmerandfarmer.org/medicine/future.html">Jonathan Harris</a> predicts the burden of responsibility is about to get heavier - eventually the software will be followed by hardware embedded in our bodies.</p>

<blockquote><p>Software is the staging ground for the future, affording us the time and space to get our ethics right, before the stakes are raised.</p>

<p>Because, the way these biological interventions will happen is that there will be some guy who starts a company, and he will have a small design team, and they will make certain choices, and decisions around things like default settings, and they will build their product, and release it into the world, and early adopters will adopt it, and then ordinary folks will try it too, and soon thereafter the physical bodies of millions of people will forever be augmented by the flippant choices made on a Tuesday afternoon in a little sunny room in Palo Alto. [source: <a href="http://farmerandfarmer.org/medicine/index.html">Farmer and Farmer, Essays About Humans and Technology</a>]</p></blockquote>

<p>Which is why I&#8217;m worried, and so should you be, because it means your life in the future is being decided by people who may have very little in common with you, and may not understand your needs at all. Worse: they may not even care. Even worse: they may see profit in actively working against your needs.</p>

<p>Case in point: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymwars">Google+ nymwars</a>. Not long after its launch, Google decided to start shutting down profiles of people who didn&#8217;t use their real names to sign up to the service. On one hand of course they have a right to do that, it&#8217;s their business after all to know everything about you so they can adequately price your eyeballs. At the same time, due to their size and prominence, shouldn&#8217;t large companies feel responsible about decisions they make becoming the de facto standard? &#8220;Waah, but <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Pseudonymity">pseudonymity</a> and <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Anonymity">anonymity</a> are only for BAD people who have something to hide&#8221; - I hear you think, but before you say it, check if you can see yourself on this <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Who_is_harmed_by_a_%22Real_Names%22_policy%3F">very long list of people that are harmed by real name policies</a>. We might find ourselves in twenty years time with a stifled freedom of expression, because we fell for a straw-man argument against one real, unified identity online - argument that someone created to make profit.</p>

<p>Technology is often perceived as somewhat scientific and objective, especially by non-technical audiences. I&#8217;ve come to think this is a lie. Recently, I saw <a href="http://www.scottporad.com/">Scott Porad</a> speak about it at <a href="http://devslovebacon.com/">Bacon</a>. &#8220;Software is a reflection of people and processes that created it&#8221;, he argued, and I wholeheartedly agreed. And it&#8217;s not just the software. Everywhere where decisions made that have an effect on other people - there will be biases.</p>

<p>But biases don&#8217;t always have to be a bad thing. Many tools and technologies in existence express positive values: pursuit of happiness, real human connection, attempts to fix difficult problems. Some contributors do so in their spare time, only rewarded with gratitude and sense of satisfaction.</p>

<p>The challenge is to empower more people to actively participate in thinking about and building TEH FUTURE. So why not <a href="http://codingforkids.org/wiki/Main_Page">teach kids to code</a> or <a href="http://www.kapipal.com/760573d1b2ec4ecab351982e9122ce2f">help others do so</a>?</p>

      <h2><a href="/2012/04/12/on-the-new-aesthetic">On the New Aesthetic</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">April 12, 2012</h3>
      <p>After Bruce Sterling published <a href="http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2012/04/an-essay-on-the-new-aesthetic/">his essay</a> on the <a href="http://new-aesthetic.tumblr.com/">New Aesthetic</a> last Monday, the topic exploded and responses to that essay were as quick as they were plentiful (see below for links). Suddenly it became a hotly debated subject on Twitter, so I thought what everyone desperately needed was - yep - yet another blog post on the New Aesthetic.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.g-truc.net/post/0448-3.jpg" alt="Gerhard Richter, 4096 colours, 1974" />
<em>Gerhard Richter, 4096 colours, 1974</em></p>

<p>Last week I’ve been to <a href="http://michelle.kasprzak.ca/blog/">Michelle Kasprzak</a>’s brilliant <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/programme/monthly-talk-michelle-kasprzak?query=kasprzak">talk</a> about new artistic frontiers and works made possible by recent leaps in technological advancement. It included a critique of the New Aesthetic as an art movement, pointing out its main flaw: that much of it is not new. She presented evidence of works of art from the twentieth century that could easily be thought of as belonging to the NA, but predating it. One of the examples was Gerhard Richter’s painting resembling pixels today (as we’ve learned to understand a grid of squares), painted in 1974. It’s true that some of the visual language present in items collected on the NA Tumblr existed before. What’s really been bothering me is that I don’t think that NA is an art movement at all.</p>

<p>Sure, some of the things in the NA collection are undeniably works of art (like <a href="http://new-aesthetic.tumblr.com/post/16174636454/the-project-was-based-on-data-i-gathered-by-taking">this</a>, <a href="http://new-aesthetic.tumblr.com/post/17163297795/investigating-the-rotation-of-data-these">this</a> or <a href="http://new-aesthetic.tumblr.com/post/20895023430/cardboard-papercraft-sculpture-created-from-3d">this</a>). But what this collection says to me is this: we already live in the reality where digital and physical are beginning to blend. The visual language of the machines we built is seeping into our consciousness and affecting our aesthetic preferences. We see beauty in limitations of visual artefacts produced by our tools. We already share a world with autonomous machines, and we adapt it so they can survive alongside us. It’s a body of evidence not only that the future has arrived already, but that we are already so familiar with its visual representations that we almost don’t notice there’s anything odd with it entering the physical realm.  It’s inevitable that an art movement (or maybe a number of them) can be found within the collection, but as a whole it’s bigger than this - it covers a much broader cultural area. It’s as much about art as it is about the everyday.</p>

<p>Of course, in itself, this isn’t anything new. Similar shifts in aesthetics have happened before, time and time again, because our technologies, as they become prevalent, always make their mark on our aesthetic sensibilities and our understanding of the world. Yesterday it was the industrialisation, today it’s computing. We always see the world through our tools. Today it’s through the eyes of tools that begin to see for themselves.</p>
