      <h2><a href="/2012/05/08/building-the-future">Building the Future</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">May 08, 2012</h3>
      <p><img alt='One does not simply design in a vacuum' src='/images/design_vacuum.png' /></p>

<p>Graduating from a design course at Goldsmiths bestowed me with a sense of power and a sense of responsibility. You don&#8217;t casually design stuff that will affect people&#8217;s lives without stopping first to think about it.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re finally collectively waking up to the fact that the tools of the future are largely software tools. I design and make digital things - they can sometimes seem like not real things at all. They appear so ethereal that my parents struggle to describe to friends and family what it is I do for a living. And yet with every design decision, every small feature, or lack of feature, or way of doing things - I know it can affect how people relate to one another. <a href='http://farmerandfarmer.org/medicine/future.html'>Jonathan Harris</a> predicts the burden of responsibility is about to get heavier - eventually the software will be followed by hardware embedded in our bodies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Software is the staging ground for the future, affording us the time and space to get our ethics right, before the stakes are raised.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Because, the way these biological interventions will happen is that there will be some guy who starts a company, and he will have a small design team, and they will make certain choices, and decisions around things like default settings, and they will build their product, and release it into the world, and early adopters will adopt it, and then ordinary folks will try it too, and soon thereafter the physical bodies of millions of people will forever be augmented by the flippant choices made on a Tuesday afternoon in a little sunny room in Palo Alto. <span>source: <a href='http://farmerandfarmer.org/medicine/index.html'>Farmer and Farmer, Essays About Humans and Technology</a></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is why I&#8217;m worried, and so should you be, because it means your life in the future is being decided by people who may have very little in common with you, and may not understand your needs at all. Worse: they may not even care. Even worse: they may see profit in actively working against your needs.</p>

<p>Case in point: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymwars'>Google+ nymwars</a>. Not long after its launch, Google decided to start shutting down profiles of people who didn&#8217;t use their real names to sign up to the service. On one hand of course they have a right to do that, it&#8217;s their business after all to know everything about you so they can adequately price your eyeballs. At the same time, due to their size and prominence, shouldn&#8217;t large companies feel responsible about decisions they make becoming the de facto standard? &#8220;Waah, but <a href='http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Pseudonymity'>pseudonymity</a> and <a href='http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Anonymity'>anonymity</a> are only for BAD people who have something to hide&#8221; - I hear you think, but before you say it, check if you can see yourself on this <a href='http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Who_is_harmed_by_a_%22Real_Names%22_policy%3F'>very long list of people that are harmed by real name policies</a>. We might find ourselves in twenty years time with a stifled freedom of expression, because we fell for a straw-man argument against one real, unified identity online - argument that someone created to make profit.</p>

<p>Technology is often perceived as somewhat scientific and objective, especially by non-technical audiences. I&#8217;ve come to think this is a lie. Recently, I saw <a href='http://www.scottporad.com/'>Scott Porad</a> speak about it at <a href='http://devslovebacon.com/'>Bacon</a>. &#8220;Software is a reflection of people and processes that created it&#8221;, he argued, and I wholeheartedly agreed. And it&#8217;s not just the software. Everywhere where decisions made that have an effect on other people - there will be biases.</p>

<p>But biases don&#8217;t always have to be a bad thing. Many tools and technologies in existence express positive values: pursuit of happiness, real human connection, attempts to fix difficult problems. Some contributors do so in their spare time, only rewarded with gratitude and sense of satisfaction.</p>

<p>The challenge is to empower more people to actively participate in thinking about and building TEH FUTURE. So why not <a href='http://codingforkids.org/wiki/Main_Page'>teach kids to code</a> or <a href='http://www.kapipal.com/760573d1b2ec4ecab351982e9122ce2f'>help others do so</a>?</p>

      <h2><a href="/2012/04/12/on-the-new-aesthetic">On the New Aesthetic</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">April 12, 2012</h3>
      <p>After Bruce Sterling published <a href='http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2012/04/an-essay-on-the-new-aesthetic/'>his essay</a> on the <a href='http://new-aesthetic.tumblr.com/'>New Aesthetic</a> last Monday, the topic exploded and responses to that essay were as quick as they were plentiful (see below for links). Suddenly it became a hotly debated subject on Twitter, so I thought what everyone desperately needed was - yep - yet another blog post on the New Aesthetic.</p>

<p><img alt='Gerhard Richter, 4096 colours, 1974' src='http://www.g-truc.net/post/0448-3.jpg' /> <em>Gerhard Richter, 4096 colours, 1974</em></p>

<p>Last week I’ve been to <a href='http://michelle.kasprzak.ca/blog/'>Michelle Kasprzak</a>’s brilliant <a href='http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/programme/monthly-talk-michelle-kasprzak?query=kasprzak'>talk</a> about new artistic frontiers and works made possible by recent leaps in technological advancement. It included a critique of the New Aesthetic as an art movement, pointing out its main flaw: that much of it is not new. She presented evidence of works of art from the twentieth century that could easily be thought of as belonging to the NA, but predating it. One of the examples was Gerhard Richter’s painting resembling pixels today (as we’ve learned to understand a grid of squares), painted in 1974. It’s true that some of the visual language present in items collected on the NA Tumblr existed before. What’s really been bothering me is that I don’t think that NA is an art movement at all.</p>

<p>Sure, some of the things in the NA collection are undeniably works of art (like <a href='http://new-aesthetic.tumblr.com/post/16174636454/the-project-was-based-on-data-i-gathered-by-taking'>this</a>, <a href='http://new-aesthetic.tumblr.com/post/17163297795/investigating-the-rotation-of-data-these'>this</a> or <a href='http://new-aesthetic.tumblr.com/post/20895023430/cardboard-papercraft-sculpture-created-from-3d'>this</a>). But what this collection says to me is this: we already live in the reality where digital and physical are beginning to blend. The visual language of the machines we built is seeping into our consciousness and affecting our aesthetic preferences. We see beauty in limitations of visual artefacts produced by our tools. We already share a world with autonomous machines, and we adapt it so they can survive alongside us. It’s a body of evidence not only that the future has arrived already, but that we are already so familiar with its visual representations that we almost don’t notice there’s anything odd with it entering the physical realm. It’s inevitable that an art movement (or maybe a number of them) can be found within the collection, but as a whole it’s bigger than this - it covers a much broader cultural area. It’s as much about art as it is about the everyday.</p>

<p>Of course, in itself, this isn’t anything new. Similar shifts in aesthetics have happened before, time and time again, because our technologies, as they become prevalent, always make their mark on our aesthetic sensibilities and our understanding of the world. Yesterday it was the industrialisation, today it’s computing. We always see the world through our tools. Today it’s through the eyes of tools that begin to see for themselves.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2012/04/02/beginning-a-residency-at-the-lighthouse-as-a-technologist">Beginning a residency at the Lighthouse as a technologist - Happenstance Project</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">April 02, 2012</h3>
      <p>Until the end of June I am a <a href='http://happenstanceproject.com/'>resident technologist</a> at the <a href='http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/'>Lighthouse</a> in Brighton, together with <a href='http://shorttermmemoryloss.com/'>James Bridle</a>.</p>

<p>The Lighthouse is an interesting organisation - it describes itself as a digital culture agency, rather than simply a digital arts agency, emphasising its broad interests that go beyond the arts sector. It&#8217;s an organisation that is forward looking and welcomes the challenges presented by technology. Perhaps this is why they are confident enough to let me and James drive the process without necessarily having a clear idea of the outcome (or direction) just yet.</p>

<p>Their openness was what attracted me to the project. I could work using the process in which you gradually narrow your problem space to eventually define the project&#8217;s objectives is what they would like to happen. This kind of approach from my experience can result in something much more interesting than when the outcome is clearly defined at the beginning. While it may not be suitable for every type of project, it feels exactly right for <a href='http://happenstanceproject.com/'>Happenstance</a>, where the goals are much wider than simply delivering a product. You can probably tell by now that I am excited about having an opportunity to further develop my practice.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t worked with any arts organisations before, so it will be interesting to find out more about the work they do and how they do it. Lighthouse not only exhibits existing work, but also acts in a commissioning capacity, as well as doing administrative and supportive work that is largely hidden from public view. Any impact that this project will have on the way Lighthouse operates will be felt by many more organisations, so this is a brilliant opportunity to do something great… no pressure then!</p>

      <h2><a href="/2012/01/15/drawing-robots-roundup">Drawing robots roundup</a></h2>
      <h3 class="date">January 15, 2012</h3>
      <p>I intend to build a drawing robot soon as a part of a bigger project that will hopefully culminate in a short animation. I have just been given a broken HP Deskjet D4260 so I already have a few parts I might need. I am not yet fully decided on which approach to take, so here&#8217;s a roundup of different drawing machines to inspire me.</p>

<p>Have I mentioned yet how much I love <a href='http://tinkerlog.com/'>Alex Weber&#8217;s projects</a>? The one that led me to find his blog was <a href='http://tinkerlog.com/2011/09/02/der-kritzler/'>Der Kritzler</a> - a robot that draws on the windows. It uses a combination of <a href='http://www.processing.org/'>Processing</a>, <a href='http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php'>ImageMagick</a> and <a href='http://potrace.sourceforge.net/'>Potrace</a> to create the graphics and the movement of the bot itself is controlled by an Arduino. The device is suspended on notched tape which controls the movements.</p>

<h3 id='hektor'>Hektor</h3>
<iframe frameborder='0' height='375' src='http://player.vimeo.com/video/15823044?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0' width='500'>  </iframe>
<p><a href='http://hektor.ch/'>Hektor</a> was the project that made me fall in love with physical hacking, it&#8217;s the first one of its kind that I could find - built in 2002. It&#8217;s a small portable spraypainting device that can cover a huge wall area, but packs away into a small suitcase. Its construction directly inspired Der Kritzler - the spraycan&#8217;s movements are controlled by toothed belts.</p>

<p>Arduino-controlled suspended plotter. 3 arms are controlled by servos. I like this one a lot despite the lack of precision. Its creator, <a href='https://plus.google.com/117437757896877369617'>Puiu Bogdan</a>, <a href='http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,65561.0.html'>explains</a> that the concept itself results in very precise drawings, but his implementation still needs to be perfected. Since it took him 7 months to build this prototype I reckon it&#8217;s a little too complicated for my purposes.</p>

<p>Definitely can&#8217;t make anything similar as I intend to use mine at home, but <a href='http://www.embeddedtronics.com/uhuservo.html'>this is cool</a>.</p>

<p><a href='http://thisisnotagraffiti.tumblr.com/'>This bot</a> built by <a href='http://kannoso.org/'>So Kanno</a> and <a href='http://yang02.org/'>Takahiro Yamaguchi</a> uses a double-pendulum to randomise its graphic output. Pretty awesome.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A small circuit board featuring radio-controlled servos from a toy car drives the solenoids attached to each spray can, which in turn apply pressure to the nozzles. Both the arm and the spray cans are controlled using toy car&#8217;s radio controller, allowing the user to move the arm in a smooth arc while spraying with each of the six spray cans simultaneously, creating a large rainbow painting within seconds.</p>
