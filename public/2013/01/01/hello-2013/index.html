        <h2>Hello 2013</h2>

<h3 class="date">January 01, 2013</h3>
<p>2012 started off well â€“ I had a great job I enjoyed, working with <a href="http://webponce.com">Webponce</a>. We spent plenty of time on non-commercial and speculative projects. I had the best job title (Near-Futures Explorer, since you ask), awesome boss, and flexible working practices.</p>

<p>In April I&#8217;ve left this job (not without a great deal of sadness) to become a technologist in residence at <a href="http://lighthouse.org.uk">Lighthouse</a> as part of <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com/">Happenstance</a>, which resulted in building <a href="http://offbott.com">Offbott</a> with <a href="http://booktwo.org/">James Bridle</a> and <a href="http://fcc.ntlk.net/">running workshops teaching to code</a>.</p>

<p>I have been taking on freelance work since second year at university, but after Happenstance I decided to do it full-time. Having been spoilt by having so much freedom in my working arrangements it seemed like the best thing to do. It meant I had the chance to work with <a href="http://wearecaper.com/">Caper</a> on exciting cultural projects such as <a href="http://alarumproject.com/">Alarum</a> for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, and with <a href="http://storythings.com/">Storythings</a> on building interactive things.</p>

<p>During Happenstance sharing my skills turned out to be both enjoyable and educational, so I was keen to continue doing it. I ran a short <a href="http://2012.brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/event/schools-workshop-with-natalia-buckley/">game-making workshop</a> for local secondary school students as a part of Lighthouse&#8217;s educational programme for <a href="http://2012.brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/">Brighton Digital Festival</a>. The year has finished with a <a href="http://ntlk.github.com/creative-coding-2012/">coding workshop</a> I did with <a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/design/">Goldsmiths</a> design students, who were on the same <a href="http://goldsmithsdesignblog.com/">course</a> I graduated from.</p>

<p>I was able to devote some time to helping organise <a href="http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/">Brighton Mini Maker Faire</a> which took place in September. I&#8217;ve invited <a href="http://infovore.org/">Tom Armitage</a>, <a href="http://www.wonderlandblog.com/">Alice Taylor</a>, <a href="http://berglondon.com/studio/matt-webb/">Matt Webb</a>, <a href="http://lindasandvik.info/">Linda Sandvik</a> representing <a href="http://www.codeclub.org.uk/">Code Club</a>, <a href="http://finalbullet.com/">Leila Johnston</a> and students from Cavendish School to talk at the event about their approach to making things. Afterwards I swore I wouldn&#8217;t organise events anymore as it&#8217;s exhausting, but I quickly forgot about that and organised <a href="http://blingmycard.ntlk.net/">Bling My Card</a> workshop together with Lighthouse to raise money for <a href="http://www.rockinghorse.org.uk/">Rockinghorse</a>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year I got inspired by the idea of &#8221;<a href="http://revdancatt.com/2010/09/25/blogging-like-its-2004/">blogging like it&#8217;s 2004</a>&#8221; so I have been trying to be a lot less precious with my blog posts. I am hoping this is going to have a ripple effect on my personal projects so I will be talking about them more even if they are unfinished and imperfect. If I did the New Year resolution thing that would be one of them, but I don&#8217;t, so let&#8217;s leave it at that.</p>
