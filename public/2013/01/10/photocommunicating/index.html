<p>All good things come to pass, and so has this: <a href='http://asburyandasbury.typepad.com/blog/2012/12/instagram-didnt-get-the-tone-wrong.html'>Instagram will now be sharing data with Facebook and can use metadata associated with your images, and/or your likeness and profile information in experimental advertising that may masquerade as no advertising at all</a>.</p>

<p>Many of my friends left the service already, and I am considering doing the same. But this isn&#8217;t the Why I Left Instagram post (I have deleted my account once before and haven&#8217;t written about it then either – can I haz gold star now?). The change in Instagram&#8217;s TOC got me thinking about what it was that I actually <em>liked</em> about the service, and whether those things would be more important to me that the consequences of my grumpy face endorsing brands without my consent or renumeration.</p>

<p>When I first started using it, there were no public profiles on the web. You could see photos but only from the app, or if they were explicitly shared to other places. It meant that I could have a mostly private account, and only my friends and people I like on the web had the chance to see such wonderful visual treats like the penis-shaped mince pie or a picture of my mate&#8217;s flatmate bathing on holiday. It seemed to me like sharing a photo on Instagram was a temporary means of visual communication; an off-hand joke; a shared moment. I don&#8217;t think I have ever scrolled through anyone&#8217;s photo archive, and I don&#8217;t know if other people do, but for me it was all about being in the moment and later forgetting it.</p>

<p>But of course nothing is forgotten, this is after all the internet. I was reminded of that when the public profiles were introduced and I realised that this fleeting thing I liked so much didn&#8217;t exist in the first place. I may have as well been uploading photos to Flickr, which I used to treat almost like GitHub for photos: put there everything you&#8217;re proud of, everything that might be useful in the future, everything you absolutely must have another backup of and everything that other people might need. It was like a browsable archive of all the useful things. It didn&#8217;t ever <em>feel</em> like an immediate communication tool.</p>

<p>Dustin Curtis speaks about photography as communication beautifully in his post &#8221;<a href='http://dcurt.is/photos-for-communication'>Photography&#8217;s Third Act</a>&#8221;. He tells the story of Treehouse, a photo sharing app that in its infancy had only one feature: sharing photos. No comments. No likes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of taking photos to maintain memories, we used them for instantaneous communication. (<a href='http://dcurt.is/photos-for-communication'>Photography&#8217;s Third Act</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me this was the difference between things I would post to Flickr (memories, records) and Instagram (communication) – obviously that&#8217;s not necessarily representative of other users on each platform.</p>

<p>Tools have the potential to frame how we use them, and so Treehouse changed how people used it to its own detriment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was an awesome experience, and I loved the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>That is, until liking, comments, and titles were added. Everyone wanted and begged for those features, of course, but adding them had an unforeseeable negative side effect: they removed the expectation that photos should be used for communication, and instead gave the impression that communication should happen around the photos. (<a href='http://dcurt.is/photos-for-communication'>Photography&#8217;s Third Act</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was pondering this and realised there isn&#8217;t a service I use that allows this kind of instant communication that eventually leaves not trace, like a conversation that you have one day but next week struggle to recall. And I would like that.</p>

<p>And apparently, so would others. <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapchat/id447188370?mt=8'>Snapchat</a> is a real-time image chat, and the images you send to one another disappear quickly. It became so popular that Facebook released their own <a href='http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/21/tech/social-media/facebook-poke-app/'>Poke</a> to grab a piece of the self-destructing-photo market.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t mind the photos staying out there for a bit longer, maybe until the next one is shared. So I&#8217;ve made <a href='http://instanat.ntlk.net/'>instanat</a> (no need to laugh, I had always been upfront about my inability to name things). It&#8217;s my own photo sharing thing. I have a special folder in my Dropbox where I can add new photos, and then they end up on the web. Only one at the time, visible until I post another one.</p>

<p>The integration with Dropbox means I can post to it from a variety of photo apps, even if they don&#8217;t save directly to Dropbox. I can drop in photos and screenshots from my laptop as well.</p>

<p>I am interested to see how this will shape what I deem shareable and how I will use it, knowing that despite being fleeting-<em>ish</em><sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> it&#8217;s all completely public. We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>
<p>It&#8217;s not quite fleeting though. Because it&#8217;s just me, photos don&#8217;t get the opportunity to disappear among others in your feed over time. I am lost for a better word to describe it though.</p>
<a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></li></ol></div>
